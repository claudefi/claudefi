Judge feedback explicitly states \"Duplicate positions signal poor initial planning.\" Both positions have identical performance ($15 fees earned, 10% yield), so removing the newer position (opened at 10:55 vs 10:38). This frees up ~$165 capital ($150 + $15 fees) for diversification into higher-yield opportunities. Current SOL-USDC fee/TVL ratio (0.161) is significantly lower than alternatives like MUSH-SOL (13.42) or fish-SOL (4.84). Paper trading mode allows aggressive testing of rotation strategies.",
