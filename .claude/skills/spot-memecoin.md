# Spot Memecoin Trading Skill

## Domain: Memecoin/Token Trading via Jupiter on Solana

### Entry Signals (BUY)

**Strong buy signals:**
- Volume surge (3x+ normal volume)
- Price breakout with volume confirmation
- Social media buzz / trending on Twitter
- New narrative or catalyst
- Healthy pullback in uptrend (buy the dip)
- GT Score > 50 (legitimate token)

**Token quality checks:**
- Liquidity > $50k (can exit without massive slippage)
- Volume > $100k (active trading)
- Not just launched (avoid rugs)
- Has social presence (Twitter, Telegram)
- Clear narrative or use case

### Exit Signals (SELL)

**Sell when:**
- Volume dying (below 50% of entry volume)
- Failed to break resistance after multiple attempts
- Better opportunity elsewhere
- Profit target reached (50-100% gain)
- Stop loss triggered (20-30% loss)
- Narrative fading / hype dying

### Position Sizing

1. **Max per token**: 20% of spot balance
2. **Position limit**: Max 3 spot positions
3. **Scale in**: Don't buy all at once
4. **Scale out**: Take profits in chunks

### Risk Management

**Hard rules:**
- Never invest more than you can lose
- Always check liquidity before buying
- Verify token is not a rug (check holders, LP lock)
- Set mental stop loss before entry
- Don't average down on losers

**Slippage settings:**
- Normal: 0.5-1%
- High volatility: 2-3%
- Very illiquid: 5%+ (be careful)

### Token Evaluation Framework

| Factor | Weight | Score |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Volume trend | 25% | High/Med/Low |
| Liquidity | 20% | >$100k / $50-100k / <$50k |
| Social buzz | 20% | Trending / Active / Dead |
| Price action | 20% | Bullish / Neutral / Bearish |
| GT Score | 15% | >70 / 50-70 / <50 |

### Memecoin Lifecycle

1. **Launch**: High risk, potential 10-100x
2. **Discovery**: Volume spike, FOMO phase
3. **Peak**: Maximum attention, sell here
4. **Decline**: Volume drops, narrative fades
5. **Dead**: Minimal volume, avoid

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Buying at the top (FOMO)
2. Not checking liquidity (can't exit)
3. Holding too long (memes dump fast)
4. Over-sizing (one bad trade wipes gains)
5. Ignoring red flags (honeypots, rugs)
6. Chasing pumps without research
