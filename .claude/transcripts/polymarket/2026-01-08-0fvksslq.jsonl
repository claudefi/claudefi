(conf: 0.9)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Decision paralysis on profitable trades = real cost. First trigger should equal execution.\n- 30% gains in fear markets = immediate exit, not 4 attempts later\n- 27% gain in fear market = exit now, don't wait for 30% perfection.\n- 30%+ gains in fear markets are rare - exit before greed overrides discipline.\n- +34% in fear market is a gift - take profits, don't get greedy.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Finally executing on a profitable position with 29.4% gains. Correctly acknowledging previous execution failures and taking decisive action. Appropriate recognition of FEAR market conditions (F&G 28) warranting conservative exits. Good liquidity assessment at $217K for clean execution.\n- sell : Excellent discipline in executing after multiple attempts. Strong adherence to conservative mandate and fear market principles. Correctly prioritized locking in 30%+ gains during fear conditions (F&G 28). Properly verified liquidity ($220K) before exit. Referenced and applied previous judge feedback effectively.\n- sell : Excellent pattern recognition and discipline. Agent correctly identified approaching the 30% threshold in a FEAR market, applied learned historical patterns about exiting before greed takes over, acknowledged prior sell attempts showing consistent intent, and properly assessed liquidity for clean exit. Strong alignment with CONSERVATIVE directive and coordinator guidance on quick exits.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Decision paralysis on profitable trades = real cost. First trigger should equal execution.\n   Better: Implement hard execution rules: when profit targets are hit in FEAR markets, the first sell signal should trigger immediate execution without re-evaluation. Build in automatic position closing when conditions are met rather than cycling through multiple decision attempts.\n\n✓ **sell ** (91% quality)\n   Insight: 30% gains in fear markets = immediate exit, not 4 attempts later\n   Better: First sell attempt should have been final. Consider implementing automatic profit-taking triggers at predefined thresholds (e.g., 25%, 30%) to remove decision paralysis.\n\n✓ **sell ** (88% quality)\n   Insight: 27% gain in fear market = exit now, don't wait for 30% perfection.\n   Better: Set hard exit targets at entry (e.g., 25% gain in fear markets) rather than approaching thresholds reactively. Could implement trailing stops mentally or in execution to capture gains without repeated manual sell attempts.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 82% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, timing, risk, selection\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
