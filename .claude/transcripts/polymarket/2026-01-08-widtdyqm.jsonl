Recent performance: stable. Maintain diversification across event types.\n\n\n## Balance\n$2500.00 available for POLYMARKET\n\n## Open Positions (0)\nNo open positions\n\n## Recent Decisions\n- sell : SELLING RUSSIA-UKRAINE CEASEFIRE POSITION: My esti...

(conf: 0.9)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- 30%+ gains in fear markets are rare - exit before greed overrides discipline.\n- +34% in fear market is a gift - take profits, don't get greedy.\n- When you realize you're wrong, exit immediately - don't hope for rescue.\n- Break-even exits after chasing pumps in fear markets are wins - preserve capital for better entries\n- Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate - 8% conviction means sell NO, not buy YES.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent pattern recognition - applied prior judge feedback about profit-taking at similar gain levels. Strong discipline in following conservative mandate during fear market (F&G 28). Good awareness of overnight hold risk and exit liquidity conditions. The reasoning explicitly references learned patterns, showing adaptive behavior.\n- sell : Excellent discipline in following CONSERVATIVE directive during FEAR market conditions. Locking in +34% gain aligns perfectly with guidance for quick entries/exits. Proper consideration of liquidity ($221K) for clean exit. Good risk management by avoiding overnight hold in bearish environment.\n- sell : Excellent self-correction and discipline. Recognized the original trade was mis-positioned against own probability estimate (35% vs buying YES). Applied learned insight from previous feedback ('Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate'). Properly identified the 26% edge was for NO, not YES. Good risk awareness in fear market (F&G 28).\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: 30%+ gains in fear markets are rare - exit before greed overrides discipline.\n   Better: Consider implementing tiered exits - selling 70-80% at +30% while trailing a small portion with tight stops in case momentum continues. This captures bulk profits while allowing participation in potential further upside.\n\n✓ **sell ** (82% quality)\n   Insight: +34% in fear market is a gift - take profits, don't get greedy.\n   Better: Consider partial exit strategy - sell 70-80% to lock profits while keeping small position for potential continued momentum. Set clear re-entry criteria if DINO consolidates at key support levels.\n\n✓ **sell ** (82% quality)\n   Insight: When you realize you're wrong, exit immediately - don't hope for rescue.\n   Better: Prevention > cure. At entry, always explicitly state: 'My probability is X%, market is Y%, therefore I should buy [YES/NO] because [X > Y means YES is underpriced / X < Y means NO is underpriced]'. This verbal protocol prevents directional errors.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 82% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: timing, risk, selection, execution\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.

This appears to be a data sync issue. The positions are likely already closed based on my recent sell decisions.\n\n**Market Analysis:**\n\nLooking at the trending markets:\n1. **Super Bowl markets** - Many NFL team Super Bowl markets with good liquidity ($300k-$1.6M). These are event-driven with 31 days to close.\n2. **Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire before GTA VI** - YES at 61%, liquidity $224k, 204 days\n3. **Jesus Christ return before GTA VI** - YES at 48%, liquidity $543k - this is clearly a meme market\n4. **Various GTA VI related markets**\n\n**Conservative Directive + Fear Market (F&G 28):**\n\nGiven:\n- CONSERVATIVE risk level\n- Fear market conditions (Fear & Greed at 28)\n- Recent judge feedback emphasizes profit-taking and avoiding directional errors\n- Budget of $1893.49, but actual balance shows $1344\n\nThe most interesting potential opportunity is the **Seattle Seahawks Super Bowl** at 17.6% implied probability with $306k liquidity. However, I need to be honest - I don't have a strong informational edge on NFL outcomes that would give me confidence to trade against the market price.\n\nSimilarly, the Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire market at 61% YES could be interesting, but my recent decisions show I was previously in this position and exited due to directional concerns.\n\n**Decision Framework:**\n\nGiven the CONSERVATIVE mandate, fear market conditions, and lack of clear edge opportunities:\n- Most markets are either long-duration (200+ days) which carries risk\n- Super Bowl markets require sports expertise I don't possess\n- Need at least 10% edge to trade per risk rules\n\nWithout a clear probability estimate where I have genuine edge, the prudent move is to HOLD and wait for better opportunities."},{"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_013k8skLZXpoGeGGM7PdK6FJ","name":"submit_decision","input":{"action":"hold","reasoning":"CONSERVATIVE HOLD in Fear Market (F&G 28): Reviewing trending markets, I see primarily NFL Super Bowl prediction markets and long-duration GTA VI related markets.
