(conf: 0.88)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Lock in 50% gains during Fear conditions - sentiment can deteriorate rapidly overnight\n- Always check time-to-resolution before cutting prediction market losses - late-stage drops differ from early ones.\n- Verify metadata prices against live markets before executing loss-cutting decisions.\n- Exit winners when technicals flip bearish; don't let profits become losses.\n- After 3 failed executions, diagnose the system before retrying blindly.\n\n### Warnings to Heed\n\n*These patterns led to poor decisions recently:*\n\n- open_long ZEC: Catching falling knives based solely on RSI extremes is a low-probability strategy. RSI of 16.9 can stay oversold for extended periods in strong downtrends. 11% below EMA20 suggests strong bearish momentum, not a buying opportunity. No consideration of support levels, volume, or broader market context.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell 36c1c0b4-7496-4650-8090-4d9ca55f63f3: Strong profit-taking discipline with 50% unrealized gain. Good liquidity verification ($213K > $50K threshold). Aligned with bearish market sentiment (Fear & Greed 28) and coordinator directive for conservative exits. Position sizing appropriate for clean exit.\n- sell 31e4ea48-2a16-4b54-8d9b-75096aec152e: Sound risk management approach - cutting losses at 50% decline is disciplined. Good recognition of capital constraints ($1.00 balance) and alignment with coordinator's conservative directive. Properly referenced previous judge feedback patterns to justify decision consistency.\n- sell 31e4ea48-2a16-4b54-8d9b-75096aec152e: Disciplined application of portfolio cleanup principles. Correctly identified the position as underwater with 50% unrealized loss. Properly recognized capital constraints ($1.00 balance) limiting alternative actions. Referenced and applied validated judge feedback patterns appropriately.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell 36c1c0b4-7496-4650-8090-4d9ca55f63f3** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Lock in 50% gains during Fear conditions - sentiment can deteriorate rapidly overnight\n   Better: Decision logic is sound. The execution layer should have circuit breakers to prevent 13+ repeated decision cycles on the same trade. Consider implementing order status tracking to avoid redundant decision evaluations.\n\n✓ **sell 31e4ea48-2a16-4b54-8d9b-75096aec152e** (72% quality)\n   Insight: Always check time-to-resolution before cutting prediction market losses - late-stage drops differ from early ones.\n   Better: Before selling, evaluate: (1) Time remaining until market resolution, (2) Whether price decline reflects new information or just sentiment, (3) Current implied probability vs. your assessed true probability. Only sell if negative edge persists or capital needed for higher-conviction opportunities.\n\n✓ **sell 31e4ea48-2a16-4b54-8d9b-75096aec152e** (78% quality)\n   Insight: Verify metadata prices against live markets before executing loss-cutting decisions.\n   Better: Before selling, verify current live market price independently. Assess time-to-expiration: if resolution is imminent and YES has any non-trivial chance, holding might outperform crystallizing losses. Consider if the drop from 50% to 25% was due to new information or market noise.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 77% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: timing, execution, selection, risk\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.

Current BTC ~$100K would need 10x in ~200 days - historically unprecedented. Even during 2017/2021 bull runs, BTC never 10x'd in 6 months from a $100K base. My estimate is 5% YES probability, giving a 43% edge on NO. Liquidity is solid at $256K. This is paper trading so taking a position to test this clear mispricing. Starting with $100 (conservative) to validate the trade thesis before scaling up.","confidence":0.85}},"metadata":{"domain":"polymarket","toolName":"submit_decision"}}
