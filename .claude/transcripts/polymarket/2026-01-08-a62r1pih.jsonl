(conf: 0.95)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- When confidence >90% aligns with mandate rules, execute immediately - hesitation erodes edge\n- Never enter when your probability estimate is 6x lower than market price - that's not alpha, it's recklessness.\n- Build execution triggers as rules, not decisions - 4 attempts = 4 failures before success\n- Decision paralysis on profitable trades = real cost. First trigger should equal execution.\n- 30% gains in fear markets = immediate exit, not 4 attempts later\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent discipline in executing profit-taking at +40% in a fear market (F&G 28). Strong alignment with conservative mandate. Recognition of previous execution failures and commitment to breaking that pattern. Good liquidity assessment ($231K) ensures clean exit.\n- sell : Disciplined loss-cutting on a fundamentally flawed position. Good recognition that 8% probability estimate vs 50% entry price was a critical error. Proper adherence to portfolio constraints (3-position max) and risk mandate (CONSERVATIVE in FEAR conditions). Acting decisively rather than hoping for recovery.\n- sell : Finally executing on a repeatedly validated decision. Strong alignment with conservative mandate in fear market. Clear self-awareness of decision paralysis pattern. Excellent liquidity assessment ($220K sufficient for clean exit). 30%+ gain capture in unfavorable sentiment is solid risk management.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (92% quality)\n   Insight: When confidence >90% aligns with mandate rules, execute immediately - hesitation erodes edge\n   Better: Execute immediately on first signal when confidence exceeds 90% and decision aligns with mandate. Consider implementing automated triggers for profit-taking thresholds in conservative mode to remove human hesitation.\n\n✓ **sell ** (72% quality)\n   Insight: Never enter when your probability estimate is 6x lower than market price - that's not alpha, it's recklessness.\n   Better: Position should never have been entered at 50% when estimated probability was only 8%. If entered, should have had automatic exit triggers at 20-30% loss maximum. For future cleanup decisions, consider whether the near-zero residual value is even worth the transaction costs.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Build execution triggers as rules, not decisions - 4 attempts = 4 failures before success\n   Better: Implement hard rules: 30%+ gain + fear market + conservative mandate = auto-execute on first signal. No second-guessing. Consider tiered exits (50% at 25%, 50% at 35%) to remove emotional burden of timing perfect exit.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 83% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, selection, timing, risk\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
