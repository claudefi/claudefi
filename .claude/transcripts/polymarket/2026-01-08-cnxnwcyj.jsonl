(conf: 0.9)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- +34% in fear market is a gift - take profits, don't get greedy.\n- When you realize you're wrong, exit immediately - don't hope for rescue.\n- Break-even exits after chasing pumps in fear markets are wins - preserve capital for better entries\n- Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate - 8% conviction means sell NO, not buy YES.\n- Break-even after 43% pump signals bad entry - focus on improving entry timing.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent discipline in following CONSERVATIVE directive during FEAR market conditions. Locking in +34% gain aligns perfectly with guidance for quick entries/exits. Proper consideration of liquidity ($221K) for clean exit. Good risk management by avoiding overnight hold in bearish environment.\n- sell : Excellent self-correction and discipline. Recognized the original trade was mis-positioned against own probability estimate (35% vs buying YES). Applied learned insight from previous feedback ('Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate'). Properly identified the 26% edge was for NO, not YES. Good risk awareness in fear market (F&G 28).\n- sell : Excellent risk management discipline - exiting at break-even in extreme fear (F&G 28) with overnight risk aligns perfectly with conservative directive. Recognized good exit liquidity (64% buy ratio) and correctly prioritized capital preservation over potential gains. Consistent application of coordinator guidance for quick entries/exits.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (82% quality)\n   Insight: +34% in fear market is a gift - take profits, don't get greedy.\n   Better: Consider partial exit strategy - sell 70-80% to lock profits while keeping small position for potential continued momentum. Set clear re-entry criteria if DINO consolidates at key support levels.\n\n✓ **sell ** (82% quality)\n   Insight: When you realize you're wrong, exit immediately - don't hope for rescue.\n   Better: Prevention > cure. At entry, always explicitly state: 'My probability is X%, market is Y%, therefore I should buy [YES/NO] because [X > Y means YES is underpriced / X < Y means NO is underpriced]'. This verbal protocol prevents directional errors.\n\n✓ **sell ** (72% quality)\n   Insight: Break-even exits after chasing pumps in fear markets are wins - preserve capital for better entries\n   Better: Earlier recognition of entry timing issues - if entering post-pump in fear markets, set tighter profit targets or use limit orders at slight premium. Consider scaling into positions rather than full entry, especially when chasing momentum.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 81% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: timing, risk, selection, execution\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.

The Super Bowl markets are mostly \"long-shot\" bets that are appropriately priced. The Russia-Ukraine ceasefire market I already sold and would need a strong conviction to re-enter.\n\nLooking at the market context:\n- Fear market (28) = Should be cautious\n- Conservative directive = Avoid aggressive positions\n- Super Bowl 2026 is about a month away - limited information advantage\n- No clear edge detected on the displayed markets\n\nHowever, the paper trading directive says to be more aggressive and find opportunities. Let me think about the Seahawks at 17.8%...\n\nThe Seahawks are currently in the playoffs. At 17.8% implied probability with $1.4M liquidity, this is a tradeable market. But do I have an edge?

No clear informational edge on current markets\n5. Just cleared 3 losing positions\n\nI think the prudent decision here is to HOLD and wait for better opportunities with clearer edges.
