(conf: 0.92)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Dead positions cost attention even when they cost nothing else - close them fast.\n- Entry price vs probability estimation gap >2x = immediate red flag, no entry without justification\n- Never enter positions at 6x your estimated fair value - entry discipline prevents cleanup pain.\n- 37%+ gain in fear market with strong liquidity = immediate execution, zero hesitation\n- Clear rules demand immediate execution - hesitation on attempt 5 means 4 wasted signals.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent application of previous learnings - agent recognized decision paralysis pattern and acted decisively. Clear articulation of sunk cost logic. Position cleanup frees capital and mental bandwidth for better opportunities. High confidence aligned with straightforward decision context.\n- sell : Excellent recognition of the critical entry price vs probability estimation gap (8% vs 50%). Clear understanding that the 6x overvaluation at entry was the root cause of losses. Good application of learned rules: avoiding decision paralysis, freeing position slots for new opportunities, and adhering to conservative mandate.\n- sell : Excellent recognition of the original entry error (buying at 50% when estimated probability was 8%). Strong application of previous judge feedback about decision paralysis. Clear articulation of reasons: freeing position slot, stopping capital bleed, avoiding sunk cost fallacy. High confidence appropriate for cleanup decision.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Dead positions cost attention even when they cost nothing else - close them fast.\n   Better: Could have verified exact remaining value and compared gas costs to ensure closing makes economic sense. A brief check on whether the token is completely dead vs temporarily crashed would add rigor, but speed of execution here is likely more valuable.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Entry price vs probability estimation gap >2x = immediate red flag, no entry without justification\n   Better: Implement automatic stop-loss triggers at entry time based on probability estimation confidence. If estimated probability is 8% and entry is at 50%, should have immediate red flag preventing entry or requiring smaller position size. Position should have been exited much earlier when the estimation gap became apparent.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Never enter positions at 6x your estimated fair value - entry discipline prevents cleanup pain.\n   Better: The better approach was never entering this trade. For cleanup: execute immediately without extensive reasoning - the decision is obvious. Future prevention: implement max loss thresholds (e.g., exit at 80% loss automatically) to avoid positions reaching 99.9% drawdown.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 85% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, selection\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
