(conf: 0.95)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- In fear markets, full profit-taking on 30%+ gains beats partial exits - velocity matters.\n- Exit discipline matters as much as entry discipline - set loss thresholds upfront.\n- In bearish markets, a bird in hand (+34% realized) beats two in the bush.\n- Entry discipline > exit discipline. Bad entries can't be fixed by good exits.\n- Never buy above your estimated probability - entry discipline prevents forced exits.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent alignment with coordinator directive (CONSERVATIVE) and prior judge feedback. Proper recognition of bearish sentiment (F&G 28) creating overnight risk. Strong profit-taking discipline on a +30% gain rather than holding for more. Good synthesis of market conditions (major assets declining 3-5%) with position-specific performance.\n- sell : Excellent self-awareness in recognizing the original entry was a discipline failure. Correctly applying previous judge feedback about dead positions costing attention. Strong reasoning about probability vs price disconnect (bought at 50 cents implying 50% when estimate was 8%). Prioritizing portfolio hygiene in bearish market conditions.\n- sell : Excellent risk management discipline - taking profits on a +34% gain in a bearish market (Fear & Greed 28) aligns perfectly with conservative directive. Clear reasoning chain connecting coordinator guidance, market sentiment, and memecoin correlation risks. Demonstrates mature exit discipline over greed.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (88% quality)\n   Insight: In fear markets, full profit-taking on 30%+ gains beats partial exits - velocity matters.\n   Better: Could have implemented a scaled exit: 70% immediate profit-taking with 30% trailing stop to capture any remaining momentum while still honoring conservative stance. Set specific re-entry criteria at lower prices if market fear intensifies.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Exit discipline matters as much as entry discipline - set loss thresholds upfront.\n   Better: Implement automatic stop-losses or position review triggers when holdings drop below threshold values (e.g., 50% loss) rather than waiting for 99.9% drawdown. The lesson was learned but the tuition was maximum.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: In bearish markets, a bird in hand (+34% realized) beats two in the bush.\n   Better: Consider tiered exit strategy - sell 50-70% to lock profits while letting remainder ride with tight stop-loss. This balances profit preservation with upside capture in strong momentum conditions.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 85% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, risk, selection\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.

The Super Bowl markets are too efficient, and the meme markets (Jesus returning before GTA VI) are not serious trading opportunities. Better to preserve capital for when clear mispricing emerges."}],"metadata":{"domain":"polymarket","model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","tokensUsed":269}}
