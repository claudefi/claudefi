Good discipline in cleaning up a flawed position despite psychological difficulty of realizing losses. Proper documentation of the original thesis violation.\n- sell : Excellent adherence to CONSERVATIVE mandate and judge feedback. 31.46% gain in fear market (F&G 28) is substantial and exit is correctly prioritized. Good recognition of liquidity conditions ($227k liquidity, $2.5M volume) enabling clean execution. Persistence through 5 failed attempts shows discipline.\n- sell : Excellent discipline in following learned rules about profit-taking in fear markets. Clear reasoning linking 31.81% gain with F&G 28 fear conditions. Strong acknowledgment of conservative mandate and overnight risk. Persistence through multiple attempts shows commitment to risk management over greed.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Review new positions within 24hrs to catch thesis violations before they compound.\n   Better: Should have recognized the thesis violation within hours/days of entry and exited immediately, or better yet, never entered the position. Implement position review within 24-48 hours of any entry to validate edge alignment.\n\n✓ **sell ** (92% quality)\n   Insight: Repeated execution failures need root cause analysis, not just retry attempts.\n   Better: After 2-3 failed exit attempts, should implement diagnostic check on execution layer before continuing. Consider partial exits if full position exits keep failing. Document specific error types for each failure.\n\n✓ **sell ** (95% quality)\n   Insight: 32% gain in fear market = exit immediately, but debug execution failures after 2 attempts\n   Better: After 2 failed exit attempts, should escalate to alternative execution methods (limit orders, split exits) rather than repeating the same approach 5 times.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 88% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: risk, execution, selection\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
