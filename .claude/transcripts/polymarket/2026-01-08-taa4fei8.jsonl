(conf: 0.88)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- In extreme fear, 25% gains are rare gifts - take them before overnight risk materializes.\n- Never enter positions where your estimate contradicts the trade direction - edge sign matters.\n- After 2 failed exits, diagnose the failure mode before retry #3\n- Exit negative-edge positions immediately - time in bad trades compounds mistakes.\n- Never enter when market price exceeds your probability estimate - that's buying negative edge.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Strong risk management discipline - locking in 24.64% gain during extreme fear (28) aligns perfectly with conservative directive. Persistence through 8 failed attempts shows commitment to the exit thesis. Good recognition that overnight holds in bearish macro are risky.\n- sell : Clear recognition of negative edge position (29% gap between market and estimate). Correctly identifies this as a thesis violation from entry. Appropriately prioritizes position cleanup based on largest negative edge. Good persistence despite execution failures. Risk-aware reasoning considering market fear environment.\n- sell : Strong profit-taking discipline at +26.67% in fear market (28). Persistent execution despite 7 prior failed attempts shows commitment to thesis. Good risk awareness with conservative approach.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: In extreme fear, 25% gains are rare gifts - take them before overnight risk materializes.\n   Better: Set a trailing stop or scaled exit strategy after first exit attempt failed. Could have used limit orders at specific levels rather than repeated market sell attempts. Define clearer criteria for when strong momentum justifies holding longer despite macro fear.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Never enter positions where your estimate contradicts the trade direction - edge sign matters.\n   Better: After 2 failed execution attempts, should have: 1) Diagnosed the specific failure mode, 2) Considered alternative exit strategies (limit orders, partial exits), 3) Escalated the technical issue. Also should implement pre-trade checklist to catch edge-sign mismatches before entry.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: After 2 failed exits, diagnose the failure mode before retry #3\n   Better: After 2-3 failed attempts, should have: 1) Diagnosed execution failure mode, 2) Adjusted order parameters (smaller size, different slippage tolerance), 3) Considered partial exits instead of full position. Document failure modes for future reference.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 85% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: timing, selection, execution, risk\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
