RSI of 16.9 can stay oversold for extended periods in strong downtrends. 11% below EMA20 suggests strong bearish momentum, not a buying opportunity. No consideration of support levels, volume, or broader market context.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell 2e65bf74-b1da-4d92-91fc-85284b09744e: Excellent discipline in profit-taking during fear market (Index 28). 25% gain on a position in bearish conditions is significant. Properly citing previous judge feedback and following conservative coordinator directive. Good liquidity assessment ($217K) ensures clean exit. Persistence in pursuing the right action despite technical issues shows strong risk management conviction.\n- sell 773640a1-3771-4a4d-aa31-cafb685bab28: Strong quantitative reasoning with clear edge calculation (-40%). Good use of multiple data points: required price appreciation (11x), timeframe (204 days), and current market sentiment (Fear & Greed at 28). Follows systematic portfolio cleanup approach prioritizing worst-edge positions.\n- sell : Excellent risk management by identifying and prioritizing exit of the largest negative edge position. Clear quantitative analysis showing 40% probability gap. Sound reasoning to exit YES position when thesis strongly favors NO. Proper prioritization among multiple problematic positions.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell 2e65bf74-b1da-4d92-91fc-85284b09744e** (88% quality)\n   Insight: After 3 failed executions, diagnose the system before retrying blindly.\n   Better: After 3-4 failed attempts, should have paused to diagnose the execution issue rather than continuing identical attempts. Consider partial sells if full position exits are failing. Document the failure pattern for systematic resolution.\n\n✓ **sell 773640a1-3771-4a4d-aa31-cafb685bab28** (82% quality)\n   Insight: Exit extreme negative-edge positions first; 11x in 204 days needs extraordinary catalysts.\n   Better: Could supplement sentiment analysis with on-chain metrics and historical precedent for 10x+ moves. Consider partial exit rather than full exit if position size warrants it.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Exit largest negative-edge positions first when cleaning up portfolio misalignments\n   Better: Include explicit calculation showing required Bitcoin growth rate to reach $1M before expected GTA VI release. Consider partial position reduction if liquidity is limited. Document specific catalysts that would change the 8% estimate.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 79% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, selection, risk, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
