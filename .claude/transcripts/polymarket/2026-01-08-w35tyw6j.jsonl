(conf: 0.95)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Never buy above your estimated probability - entry discipline prevents forced exits.\n- A -100% loss is a risk management failure, not just a cleanup task.\n- Dead positions cost attention even when they cost nothing else - close them fast.\n- Entry price vs probability estimation gap >2x = immediate red flag, no entry without justification\n- Never enter positions at 6x your estimated fair value - entry discipline prevents cleanup pain.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Agent demonstrates excellent self-reflection by identifying the root cause of the loss (entry price discipline). Recognizes that the market thesis was actually correct (60% YES now vs 35% estimate) - the execution was flawed, not the analysis. Cleaning up dead positions to start fresh is sound portfolio management.\n- sell : Excellent application of previous judge feedback about dead positions. No sunk cost fallacy - recognized the $500 is gone regardless of action. High confidence appropriate for a clear-cut cleanup decision. Properly framed as freeing attention and position slot for better opportunities.\n- sell : Excellent application of previous learnings - agent recognized decision paralysis pattern and acted decisively. Clear articulation of sunk cost logic. Position cleanup frees capital and mental bandwidth for better opportunities. High confidence aligned with straightforward decision context.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Never buy above your estimated probability - entry discipline prevents forced exits.\n   Better: Before selling, explicitly evaluate: (1) Current position size and remaining value, (2) Whether 60% market price represents fair value or momentum overshoot, (3) Cost of waiting vs immediate exit. The 'expensive lesson' mindset may be causing premature exit during recovery.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: A -100% loss is a risk management failure, not just a cleanup task.\n   Better: Implement automatic monitoring for positions down >50% that triggers immediate review. The cleanup is correct now, but the real lesson is in prevention - this position needed action at -30%, -50%, -70% at the latest.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Dead positions cost attention even when they cost nothing else - close them fast.\n   Better: Could have verified exact remaining value and compared gas costs to ensure closing makes economic sense. A brief check on whether the token is completely dead vs temporarily crashed would add rigor, but speed of execution here is likely more valuable.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 84% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, risk, selection\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
