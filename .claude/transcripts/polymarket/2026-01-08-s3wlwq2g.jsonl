(conf: 0.95)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- In fear markets, full profit-taking on 30%+ gains beats partial exits - velocity matters.\n- Exit discipline matters as much as entry discipline - set loss thresholds upfront.\n- In bearish markets, a bird in hand (+34% realized) beats two in the bush.\n- Entry discipline > exit discipline. Bad entries can't be fixed by good exits.\n- Never buy above your estimated probability - entry discipline prevents forced exits.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent alignment with coordinator directive (CONSERVATIVE) and prior judge feedback. Proper recognition of bearish sentiment (F&G 28) creating overnight risk. Strong profit-taking discipline on a +30% gain rather than holding for more. Good synthesis of market conditions (major assets declining 3-5%) with position-specific performance.\n- sell : Excellent self-awareness in recognizing the original entry was a discipline failure. Correctly applying previous judge feedback about dead positions costing attention. Strong reasoning about probability vs price disconnect (bought at 50 cents implying 50% when estimate was 8%). Prioritizing portfolio hygiene in bearish market conditions.\n- sell : Excellent risk management discipline - taking profits on a +34% gain in a bearish market (Fear & Greed 28) aligns perfectly with conservative directive. Clear reasoning chain connecting coordinator guidance, market sentiment, and memecoin correlation risks. Demonstrates mature exit discipline over greed.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (88% quality)\n   Insight: In fear markets, full profit-taking on 30%+ gains beats partial exits - velocity matters.\n   Better: Could have implemented a scaled exit: 70% immediate profit-taking with 30% trailing stop to capture any remaining momentum while still honoring conservative stance. Set specific re-entry criteria at lower prices if market fear intensifies.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Exit discipline matters as much as entry discipline - set loss thresholds upfront.\n   Better: Implement automatic stop-losses or position review triggers when holdings drop below threshold values (e.g., 50% loss) rather than waiting for 99.9% drawdown. The lesson was learned but the tuition was maximum.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: In bearish markets, a bird in hand (+34% realized) beats two in the bush.\n   Better: Consider tiered exit strategy - sell 50-70% to lock profits while letting remainder ride with tight stop-loss. This balances profit preservation with upside capture in strong momentum conditions.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 85% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, risk, selection\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
