Recent performance: stable. Maintain diversification across event types.\n\n\n## Balance\n$2500.00 available for POLYMARKET\n\n## Open Positions (0)\nNo open positions\n\n## Recent Decisions\n- sell : CRITICAL DIRECTIONAL ERROR - THIRD POSITION CLEANU... (conf: 0.95)\n- sell : CRITICAL DIRECTIONAL ERROR - SELL: I'm holding YES... (conf: 0.95)\n- sell : CRITICAL DIRECTIONAL ERROR CORRECTION: I'm holding... (conf: 0.9)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- 33%+ gains in F&G 28 = full exit justified; fear markets punish greed quickly\n- Hardcode directional logic: estimate < market = BUY NO, never rely on manual verification\n- A -100% loss exit is not risk management - it's damage acknowledgment. Stop-losses must trigger earlier.\n- Always verify trade direction matches your probability thesis BEFORE entry, not after.\n- Lock 80%+ of gains at target in fear markets; let 20% ride with tight stop\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell DINO: Excellent application of learned patterns: securing 33%+ gains in fear market conditions (F&G 28) aligns perfectly with judge guidance to lock 80%+ of gains. Strong adherence to coordinator's CONSERVATIVE directive and avoiding overnight holds. Building on previous successful sell decision at +31.49%.\n- sell : Agent correctly identified the directional error and is taking corrective action to close the losing position. The implementation of a mandatory pre-trade checklist shows strong learning and process improvement. The 95% confidence in the cleanup decision is appropriate.\n- sell : Appropriate application of stop-loss discipline in fear market conditions. Recognized catastrophic loss scenario and prioritized capital preservation over hopeful recovery. Decision aligned with coordinator guidance for quick exits in bearish environment.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell DINO** (87% quality)\n   Insight: 33%+ gains in F&G 28 = full exit justified; fear markets punish greed quickly\n   Better: Consider tiered exit strategy: sell 70% immediately to lock core profits, set trailing stop on remaining 30% to capture momentum continuation while protecting downside. This balances capital preservation with upside participation.\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Hardcode directional logic: estimate < market = BUY NO, never rely on manual verification\n   Better: The proposed checklist is exactly what was needed from the start: 1) State probability estimate, 2) Compare to market, 3) Derive correct direction (estimate < market = NO, estimate > market = YES), 4) Verify before execution. This should be hardcoded into the trading logic, not a manual checklist.\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: A -100% loss exit is not risk management - it's damage acknowledgment. Stop-losses must trigger earlier.\n   Better: Implement stricter stop-losses at 20-30% drawdown rather than allowing positions to reach -100%. In fear markets with F&G at 28, tighter risk controls should be automatic. Early warning systems for rapidly declining assets like SPARK (-54.53% in 24h) should trigger exits before catastrophic losses.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 82% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: risk, execution, selection, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
