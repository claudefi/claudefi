Recent performance: stable. Maintain diversification across event types.\n\n\n## Balance\n$2500.00 available for POLYMARKET\n\n## Open Positions (0)\nNo open positions\n\n## Recent Decisions\n- sell : SELLING RUSSIA-UKRAINE CEASEFIRE POSITION: My esti...

(conf: 0.9)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- 30% gains in fear markets = immediate exit, not 4 attempts later\n- 27% gain in fear market = exit now, don't wait for 30% perfection.\n- 30%+ gains in fear markets are rare - exit before greed overrides discipline.\n- +34% in fear market is a gift - take profits, don't get greedy.\n- When you realize you're wrong, exit immediately - don't hope for rescue.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent discipline in executing after multiple attempts. Strong adherence to conservative mandate and fear market principles. Correctly prioritized locking in 30%+ gains during fear conditions (F&G 28). Properly verified liquidity ($220K) before exit. Referenced and applied previous judge feedback effectively.\n- sell : Excellent pattern recognition and discipline. Agent correctly identified approaching the 30% threshold in a FEAR market, applied learned historical patterns about exiting before greed takes over, acknowledged prior sell attempts showing consistent intent, and properly assessed liquidity for clean exit. Strong alignment with CONSERVATIVE directive and coordinator guidance on quick exits.\n- sell : Excellent pattern recognition - applied prior judge feedback about profit-taking at similar gain levels. Strong discipline in following conservative mandate during fear market (F&G 28). Good awareness of overnight hold risk and exit liquidity conditions. The reasoning explicitly references learned patterns, showing adaptive behavior.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (91% quality)\n   Insight: 30% gains in fear markets = immediate exit, not 4 attempts later\n   Better: First sell attempt should have been final. Consider implementing automatic profit-taking triggers at predefined thresholds (e.g., 25%, 30%) to remove decision paralysis.\n\n✓ **sell ** (88% quality)\n   Insight: 27% gain in fear market = exit now, don't wait for 30% perfection.\n   Better: Set hard exit targets at entry (e.g., 25% gain in fear markets) rather than approaching thresholds reactively. Could implement trailing stops mentally or in execution to capture gains without repeated manual sell attempts.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: 30%+ gains in fear markets are rare - exit before greed overrides discipline.\n   Better: Consider implementing tiered exits - selling 70-80% at +30% while trailing a small portion with tight stops in case momentum continues. This captures bulk profits while allowing participation in potential further upside.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 82% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, timing, risk, selection\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
