Recent performance: stable. Maintain diversification across event types.\n\n\n## Balance\n$2500.00 available for POLYMARKET\n\n## Open Positions (0)\nNo open positions\n\n## Recent Decisions\n- sell : CRITICAL DIRECTIONAL ERROR CORRECTION: I currently... (conf: 0.95)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Two-stage exits in fear markets: partial at target, close remainder quickly.\n- Lock profits at +25% in fear markets - partial sells preserve upside while managing downside.\n- Pre-trade checklist: verify position direction matches probability thesis before execution.\n- Always verify trade direction matches your probability thesis before execution.\n- Extreme RSI + existing position = reduce size to manage correlation risk\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent execution of a two-stage profit-taking strategy. First partial sell at +25.51%, then closing remainder at +26.51%. Properly aligned with conservative coordinator directive and fear market conditions. Good risk management by not being greedy in extreme fear environment (Fear Index 28).\n- partial_sell : Excellent risk management by taking partial profits on a +25% gainer. Decision properly balances the aggressive paper trading mandate with conservative coordinator directive. Clear exit strategy defined for remaining position. Good awareness of market sentiment (Fear at 28) and adapting position size accordingly.\n- sell : Excellent self-correction behavior. Recognized directional mismatch between probability thesis (8% YES) and actual position (holding YES shares). Applied previous judge feedback about direction verification. Clear articulation of reasoning - Bitcoin needing 10x in short timeframe is indeed extremely unlikely. High confidence appropriately matched to the clarity of the error.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (82% quality)\n   Insight: Two-stage exits in fear markets: partial at target, close remainder quickly.\n   Better: Consider a three-stage exit: 50% at +25%, 40% at target, keep 10% moonbag with tight stop. This preserves some upside if momentum continues while still locking majority of profits.\n\n✓ **partial_sell ** (78% quality)\n   Insight: Lock profits at +25% in fear markets - partial sells preserve upside while managing downside.\n   Better: Could implement a trailing stop on the remaining 50% instead of fixed exit rules. Consider the specific entry price and current P&L to optimize the partial sell percentage. A 60-40 or 70-30 split might be more optimal based on momentum strength.\n\n✓ **sell ** (88% quality)\n   Insight: Pre-trade checklist: verify position direction matches probability thesis before execution.\n   Better: Before selling, should verify current YES market price to confirm misalignment (if YES trading at 30%+ vs your 8% estimate, edge is confirmed). Consider whether immediately flipping to NO position is optimal or if waiting for better entry makes sense. Document the full trade cycle (entry price, exit price, lesson) for pattern recognition.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 81% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, risk, sizing, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
