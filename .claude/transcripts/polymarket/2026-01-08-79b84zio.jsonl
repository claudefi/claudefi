(conf: 0.9)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- When you realize you're wrong, exit immediately - don't hope for rescue.\n- Break-even exits after chasing pumps in fear markets are wins - preserve capital for better entries\n- Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate - 8% conviction means sell NO, not buy YES.\n- Break-even after 43% pump signals bad entry - focus on improving entry timing.\n- Fear market discipline: exit at 44% when rules say 33% - don't question the framework.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent self-correction and discipline. Recognized the original trade was mis-positioned against own probability estimate (35% vs buying YES). Applied learned insight from previous feedback ('Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate'). Properly identified the 26% edge was for NO, not YES. Good risk awareness in fear market (F&G 28).\n- sell : Excellent risk management discipline - exiting at break-even in extreme fear (F&G 28) with overnight risk aligns perfectly with conservative directive. Recognized good exit liquidity (64% buy ratio) and correctly prioritized capital preservation over potential gains. Consistent application of coordinator guidance for quick entries/exits.\n- sell : Correctly identifies the need to cut losses on a position that violated entry criteria. Good recognition that the original trade was a directional error (8% estimate vs 50% entry price). Appropriate prioritization of capital allocation efficiency over sunk cost fallacy. Clear application of previous judge feedback about pre-trade direction verification.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (82% quality)\n   Insight: When you realize you're wrong, exit immediately - don't hope for rescue.\n   Better: Prevention > cure. At entry, always explicitly state: 'My probability is X%, market is Y%, therefore I should buy [YES/NO] because [X > Y means YES is underpriced / X < Y means NO is underpriced]'. This verbal protocol prevents directional errors.\n\n✓ **sell ** (72% quality)\n   Insight: Break-even exits after chasing pumps in fear markets are wins - preserve capital for better entries\n   Better: Earlier recognition of entry timing issues - if entering post-pump in fear markets, set tighter profit targets or use limit orders at slight premium. Consider scaling into positions rather than full entry, especially when chasing momentum.\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate - 8% conviction means sell NO, not buy YES.\n   Better: The better approach was at entry: never enter a position where your estimate (8%) dramatically contradicts the market price (50%) without understanding why. If conviction was 8%, the trade should have been NO, not YES. Position sizing should have been minimal given the uncertainty.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 80% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: risk, timing, selection, execution\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.

Looking at the current situation:\n\n**My Current State:**\n- Balance: $1,344\n- 3 Open positions (all showing -99.9% losses): BTC $1m, Trump out, Russia-Ukraine ceasefire\n- Recent decisions were to SELL these positions (which explains the \"0 open positions\" directive)\n\n**Key Learnings from Judge Feedback:**\n1. \"Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate\"\n2. \"When you realize you're wrong, exit immediately\"\n3. \"Break-even exits after chasing pumps in fear markets are wins\"\n\n**Analyzing Available Markets:**\n\nThe Super Bowl markets are interesting but very efficient. Let me look at the non-Super Bowl markets:\n\n1. **Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire before GTA VI** - 61% YES, $224k liquidity - I have a position showing 35% estimate vs 61% market = should be NO\n2. **Jesus Christ return before GTA VI** - 49% YES - obviously this should be priced near 0%\n3. **GTA 6 cost $100+** - 1.3% YES - seems reasonable\n4. **U.S. collect less than $100b in revenue in 2025** - 29% YES - this seems interesting\n\nThe \"Jesus Christ return before GTA VI\" market at 49% YES is clearly mispriced - my estimate would be <1%. That's massive edge. However, liquidity is $543k which is good.\n\nWait - I first need to address my existing positions. They were marked for sale but still appear in the system. Let me sell these losing positions first as per my recent decisions and judge feedback.\n\nLooking at position details:\n- All 3 positions have shares at current_value of $0.50 each (negligible)\n- These positions have essentially zeroed out already\n\nGiven the negligible value remaining, let me focus on finding a new opportunity with clear edge.\n\n**Best Opportunity:**\n\"Will Jesus Christ return before GTA VI?\" at 49% YES is extremely mispriced. My probability estimate: ~0.1% (essentially impossible). Edge: ~49% on NO side.\n\nHowever, this is a novelty/meme market. Let me be more careful.\n\n**Realistic Analysis:**\nLooking at Super Bowl markets - Seattle Seahawks at 18.1% seems high. They're still in the playoffs but unlikely favorites. My estimate might be ~8-10%, giving edge on NO.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire market at 61% YES is one I've been burned on. My estimate is 35%, which would mean buying NO at $0.39 with potential to go to $0.65 (my fair value) - that's ~67% return potential.\n\nLet me be careful here - I need to ensure I'm not repeating past mistakes. The judge feedback says \"Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate.\"\n\nFor Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire:\n- Market: 61% YES\n- My estimate: 35% YES\n- This means NO is underpriced (market NO = 39%, my fair value = 65%)\n- Edge = 65% - 39% = 26% on NO\n\nThis aligns with the coordinator's \"event-driven focus\" guidance."},{"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_013p2DA8nP7S7fJRv5qingyi","name":"calculate_edge","input":{"market":"Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire before GTA VI","my_probability":35,"market_yes_price":0.61}}],"metadata":{"domain":"polymarket","model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","tokensUsed":848}}
