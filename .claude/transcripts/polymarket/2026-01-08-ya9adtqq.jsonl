(conf: 0.95)\n- sell : CRITICAL DIRECTIONAL ERROR - THIRD POSITION CLEANU... (conf: 0.95)\n- sell : CRITICAL DIRECTIONAL ERROR - SELL: I'm holding YES... (conf: 0.95)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Always verify: estimate < market = BUY NO, estimate > market = BUY YES\n- A -100% exit is autopsy, not surgery. Stop-losses must trigger before total loss.\n- 33%+ gains in F&G 28 = full exit justified; fear markets punish greed quickly\n- Hardcode directional logic: estimate < market = BUY NO, never rely on manual verification\n- A -100% loss exit is not risk management - it's damage acknowledgment. Stop-losses must trigger earlier.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent post-mortem analysis identifying root cause as directional error (buying YES when should have bought NO). Created concrete 5-step pre-trade checklist to prevent future errors. Taking responsibility and cleaning up losing positions rather than hoping for recovery.\n- sell : Correct decision to exit a catastrophically losing position. Recognition that salvaging any remaining value is better than holding through continued decline. Alignment with conservative risk mandate and avoiding overnight exposure in bearish conditions.\n- sell DINO: Excellent application of learned patterns: securing 33%+ gains in fear market conditions (F&G 28) aligns perfectly with judge guidance to lock 80%+ of gains. Strong adherence to coordinator's CONSERVATIVE directive and avoiding overnight holds. Building on previous successful sell decision at +31.49%.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Always verify: estimate < market = BUY NO, estimate > market = BUY YES\n   Better: Before ANY trade: 1) Write out thesis explicitly 2) Paper trade the logic first 3) Use smaller position sizes when learning new market dynamics 4) Implement mandatory cooling-off period between analysis and execution.\n\n✓ **sell ** (55% quality)\n   Insight: A -100% exit is autopsy, not surgery. Stop-losses must trigger before total loss.\n   Better: Implement strict stop-losses at entry that trigger at 15-25% loss maximum. The real decision point was ignored - this should have been exited much earlier when losses were recoverable. Post-mortem should focus on why position was held to -100%.\n\n✓ **sell DINO** (87% quality)\n   Insight: 33%+ gains in F&G 28 = full exit justified; fear markets punish greed quickly\n   Better: Consider tiered exit strategy: sell 70% immediately to lock core profits, set trailing stop on remaining 30% to capture momentum continuation while protecting downside. This balances capital preservation with upside participation.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 79% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, risk, selection, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
