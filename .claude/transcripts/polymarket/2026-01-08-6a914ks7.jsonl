(conf: 0.9)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Exit largest negative-edge positions first when cleaning up portfolio misalignments\n- After 3 failed executions, diagnose the problem before attempting again.\n- Extreme RSI readings in downtrends often get more extreme before reversing\n- After 3 failed exits, diagnose execution issues before retrying the same approach\n- In extreme fear, 25% gains are rare gifts - take them before overnight risk materializes.\n\n### Warnings to Heed\n\n*These patterns led to poor decisions recently:*\n\n- open_long ZEC: Catching falling knives based solely on RSI extremes is a low-probability strategy. RSI of 16.9 can stay oversold for extended periods in strong downtrends. 11% below EMA20 suggests strong bearish momentum, not a buying opportunity. No consideration of support levels, volume, or broader market context.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent risk management by identifying and prioritizing exit of the largest negative edge position. Clear quantitative analysis showing 40% probability gap. Sound reasoning to exit YES position when thesis strongly favors NO. Proper prioritization among multiple problematic positions.\n- sell : Persistence in pursuing profit-taking despite execution failures. Clear thesis alignment with conservative directive and fear market conditions. Recognition that 25% gains in fear markets are exceptional opportunities to lock in.\n- sell : Excellent persistence in executing profit-taking strategy despite multiple failed attempts. Strong risk management rationale - locking in 23% gains during extreme fear market conditions. Clear documentation of decision thesis and recognition that execution issues may need investigation.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Exit largest negative-edge positions first when cleaning up portfolio misalignments\n   Better: Include explicit calculation showing required Bitcoin growth rate to reach $1M before expected GTA VI release. Consider partial position reduction if liquidity is limited. Document specific catalysts that would change the 8% estimate.\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: After 3 failed executions, diagnose the problem before attempting again.\n   Better: After 2-3 failed attempts, pause to diagnose execution layer issues before continuing. Consider partial exits or different order types. Reduce confidence when execution repeatedly fails - the market is telling you something.\n\n✗ **open_long ZEC** (35% quality)\n   Insight: Extreme RSI readings in downtrends often get more extreme before reversing\n   Better: Wait for RSI divergence or first signs of momentum reversal rather than anticipating the bounce. Look for price stabilization with volume confirmation. Consider ZEC's historical bounce patterns from similar RSI levels. Use limit orders at key support levels instead of market entry.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 78% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: risk, execution, timing, selection\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
