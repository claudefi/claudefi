(conf: 0.95)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Never enter when your probability estimate is 6x lower than market price - that's not alpha, it's recklessness.\n- Build execution triggers as rules, not decisions - 4 attempts = 4 failures before success\n- Decision paralysis on profitable trades = real cost. First trigger should equal execution.\n- 30% gains in fear markets = immediate exit, not 4 attempts later\n- 27% gain in fear market = exit now, don't wait for 30% perfection.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Disciplined loss-cutting on a fundamentally flawed position. Good recognition that 8% probability estimate vs 50% entry price was a critical error. Proper adherence to portfolio constraints (3-position max) and risk mandate (CONSERVATIVE in FEAR conditions). Acting decisively rather than hoping for recovery.\n- sell : Finally executing on a repeatedly validated decision. Strong alignment with conservative mandate in fear market. Clear self-awareness of decision paralysis pattern. Excellent liquidity assessment ($220K sufficient for clean exit). 30%+ gain capture in unfavorable sentiment is solid risk management.\n- sell : Finally executing on a profitable position with 29.4% gains. Correctly acknowledging previous execution failures and taking decisive action. Appropriate recognition of FEAR market conditions (F&G 28) warranting conservative exits. Good liquidity assessment at $217K for clean execution.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (72% quality)\n   Insight: Never enter when your probability estimate is 6x lower than market price - that's not alpha, it's recklessness.\n   Better: Position should never have been entered at 50% when estimated probability was only 8%. If entered, should have had automatic exit triggers at 20-30% loss maximum. For future cleanup decisions, consider whether the near-zero residual value is even worth the transaction costs.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Build execution triggers as rules, not decisions - 4 attempts = 4 failures before success\n   Better: Implement hard rules: 30%+ gain + fear market + conservative mandate = auto-execute on first signal. No second-guessing. Consider tiered exits (50% at 25%, 50% at 35%) to remove emotional burden of timing perfect exit.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Decision paralysis on profitable trades = real cost. First trigger should equal execution.\n   Better: Implement hard execution rules: when profit targets are hit in FEAR markets, the first sell signal should trigger immediate execution without re-evaluation. Build in automatic position closing when conditions are met rather than cycling through multiple decision attempts.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 82% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: selection, execution, timing, risk\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.

Need to confirm if these positions are truly closed before taking new action.\n\n2. **CONSERVATIVE Mandate + FEAR Market**: Portfolio coordinator has set conservative risk level, and market sentiment is bearish (F&G: 28). This is not the time for aggressive entries.\n\n3. **Key Lesson Applied**: Judge feedback emphasized \"Never enter when your probability estimate is 6x lower than market price.\" The existing catastrophic losses (-$1,155 total) demonstrate exactly this error pattern.\n\n4. **3-Position Rule**: If positions are still open, I'm already at max allocation and cannot add new positions.\n\n5. **Available Market Analysis**:\n   - Super Bowl markets: Require specialized sports knowledge for edge\n   - GTA VI-related markets: 204+ days to resolution (capital lockup risk)\n   - Political/economic markets: Either low liquidity or difficult to estimate with confidence\n\n**Confidence: 75%** - High confidence in the conservative hold given the mandate, market conditions, and need to verify position status. Remaining 25% acknowledges paper trading mode suggests being more aggressive, but discipline after massive losses is warranted."}],"metadata":{"domain":"polymarket","model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","tokensUsed":297}}
