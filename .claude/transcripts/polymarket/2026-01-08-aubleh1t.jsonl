Recent performance: stable. Maintain diversification across event types.\n\n\n## Balance\n$2500.00 available for POLYMARKET\n\n## Open Positions (0)\nNo open positions\n\n## Recent Decisions\n- sell : CRITICAL DIRECTIONAL ERROR - SELL: I'm holding YES...

(conf: 0.9)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- A -100% loss exit is not risk management - it's damage acknowledgment. Stop-losses must trigger earlier.\n- Always verify trade direction matches your probability thesis BEFORE entry, not after.\n- Lock 80%+ of gains at target in fear markets; let 20% ride with tight stop\n- Always verify: if your estimate < market price, you should be SHORT, not LONG.\n- Pre-trade checklists prevent directional errors; apply BEFORE entry, not after 99% loss.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Appropriate application of stop-loss discipline in fear market conditions. Recognized catastrophic loss scenario and prioritized capital preservation over hopeful recovery. Decision aligned with coordinator guidance for quick exits in bearish environment.\n- sell : Excellent self-awareness in recognizing a critical directional error. Using a systematic pre-trade checklist to validate position direction. Prioritizing this as the most severe mismatch among multiple problematic positions. High confidence in the corrective action despite the painful realized loss.\n- sell 26M5M3nwgaKE4zavkD3zEtYs5hJWdxe6xBwpdtsLHy1o: Excellent discipline in executing profit-taking strategy at +31.49% gain, well above the 25% target. Strong alignment with learned patterns and coordinator directives. Good risk management recognizing fear market conditions (F&G 28) create downside risk despite strong buy ratio.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: A -100% loss exit is not risk management - it's damage acknowledgment. Stop-losses must trigger earlier.\n   Better: Implement stricter stop-losses at 20-30% drawdown rather than allowing positions to reach -100%. In fear markets with F&G at 28, tighter risk controls should be automatic. Early warning systems for rapidly declining assets like SPARK (-54.53% in 24h) should trigger exits before catastrophic losses.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Always verify trade direction matches your probability thesis BEFORE entry, not after.\n   Better: Implement mandatory pre-trade directional validation: If estimate < market, go SHORT. If estimate > market, go LONG. Add automatic position review triggers when loss exceeds 20-30%. Never hold a position where your thesis contradicts your direction.\n\n✓ **sell 26M5M3nwgaKE4zavkD3zEtYs5hJWdxe6xBwpdtsLHy1o** (88% quality)\n   Insight: Lock 80%+ of gains at target in fear markets; let 20% ride with tight stop\n   Better: Consider implementing tiered exit strategy: 50% at +25%, 30% at +30%, trailing stop on remaining 20%. This captures the core profit while allowing for potential continued upside.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 83% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: risk, selection, execution, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
