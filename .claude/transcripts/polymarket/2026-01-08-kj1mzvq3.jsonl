Recent performance: stable. Maintain diversification across event types.\n\n\n## Balance\n$2500.00 available for POLYMARKET\n\n## Open Positions (0)\nNo open positions\n\n## Recent Decisions\n- sell : CRITICAL CLEANUP - POSITION 1 (Bitcoin $1m before ... (conf: 0.95)\n- sell : CLEANUP POSITION #3 - DIRECTIONAL ERROR: Russia-Uk... (conf: 0.95)\n- sell : CRITICAL DIRECTIONAL ERROR - THIRD POSITION CLEANU... (conf: 0.95)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Break-even exits in fear markets are wins - capital preserved beats hope.\n- Directional errors demand same-day reversal, not end-of-life cleanup.\n- Always verify: estimate < market = BUY NO, estimate > market = BUY YES\n- A -100% exit is autopsy, not surgery. Stop-losses must trigger before total loss.\n- 33%+ gains in F&G 28 = full exit justified; fear markets punish greed quickly\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent risk discipline by following coordinator's CONSERVATIVE directive and avoiding overnight holds in fear market. Good pattern recognition referencing previous successful DINO exit. Rational decision to preserve capital at break-even rather than gambling on continued momentum.\n- sell : Clear recognition of the directional error pattern (estimate < market = buy NO, not YES). Good discipline in cleaning up zombie positions rather than holding false hope. Correctly prioritizes position cleanup before new trades. Strong self-awareness about the systematic mistake.\n- sell : Excellent post-mortem analysis identifying root cause as directional error (buying YES when should have bought NO). Created concrete 5-step pre-trade checklist to prevent future errors. Taking responsibility and cleaning up losing positions rather than hoping for recovery.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (78% quality)\n   Insight: Break-even exits in fear markets are wins - capital preserved beats hope.\n   Better: Set trailing stops on positions showing significant gains (+36%) to lock in profits automatically rather than letting them erode back to break-even. The strong buy ratio (65%) could have justified a tighter trailing stop rather than manual monitoring.\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Directional errors demand same-day reversal, not end-of-life cleanup.\n   Better: Implement a pre-trade checklist: 'My estimate is X%, market is Y%, therefore I should buy [YES/NO]' - verbalize this before every trade. Set automated alerts for positions that move >50% against you within first 24-48 hours to catch directional errors immediately.\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Always verify: estimate < market = BUY NO, estimate > market = BUY YES\n   Better: Before ANY trade: 1) Write out thesis explicitly 2) Paper trade the logic first 3) Use smaller position sizes when learning new market dynamics 4) Implement mandatory cooling-off period between analysis and execution.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 78% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: risk, execution, selection\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio. Make a decision.\n\n1. Use fetch tools to get current market data\n2. Analyze opportunities and risks\n3. Use submit_decision to record your action\n\nYou MUST call submit_decision with your final decision.\n","metadata":{"domain":"polymarket"}}

Let me provide a summary:\n\n## Decision Summary\n\n**Action:** SELL - Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire YES Position\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. **Directional Error Recognition:** My original estimate (35% YES) vs market price (64% YES) means I should have bought NO, not YES. This is the exact pattern the judge identified as a systematic mistake.\n\n2. **Position Cleanup:** With 3 open positions (at max capacity) all showing -99.9% losses, I need to clean up zombie positions before any new trades.\n\n3. **Risk Management:** \n   - Coordinator directive: CONSERVATIVE\n   - Market sentiment: Fear (28)\n   - Judge feedback: \"Directional errors demand same-day reversal, not end-of-life cleanup\"\n\n4. **Learning Applied:** The judge's insight \"estimate < market = BUY NO, estimate > market = BUY YES\" clearly shows this was a directional error that should have been caught before execution.\n\n**Next Steps:** After this sale, I should also clean up the other 2 zombie positions (Bitcoin $1m and Trump out before GTA VI) to have a clean slate before entering new, properly-analyzed positions with correct directional logic."}],"metadata":{"domain":"polymarket","model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","tokensUsed":278}}
