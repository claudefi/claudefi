(conf: 0.88)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Meme markets with impossible outcomes offer edge, but verify resolution criteria first.\n- Leverage violations override unrealized gains - compliance first, profits second.\n- 50% gains in Fear market = exit immediately, don't deliberate 14 times\n- Scale into dip buys rather than full position at first signal.\n- Validate position legitimacy before applying portfolio cleanup rules to avoid false signals\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- buy_no jesus-christ-return-before-gta-vi: Excellent edge identification on a meme market with clear mispricing. Strong mathematical reasoning with 47% calculated edge. Proper position sizing at 20% of balance. Good liquidity assessment at $550k. High confidence justified by the near-impossibility of the YES outcome within timeframe.\n- close_position 6d9fd368-44c1-435e-8585-a03e3f1f3280: Excellent multi-factor analysis: correctly identified leverage violation (5x vs 3x max), recognized bearish technical setup with price below EMA20, protected +15% unrealized gains in fear market conditions, maintained exposure through secondary position. Decision aligns perfectly with CONSERVATIVE directive and previous judge feedback.\n- sell af0b241a-8b56-42b6-aa21-524f7a878e69: Excellent risk management discipline - locking in 50% gains during Fear conditions (28) with conservative directive. Strong alignment between judge feedback, market sentiment, and action. Recognition that +25.53% daily pump creates reversal risk. Proper acknowledgment of overnight exposure risk.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **buy_no jesus-christ-return-before-gta-vi** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Meme markets with impossible outcomes offer edge, but verify resolution criteria first.\n   Better: Verify exact resolution criteria before entry. Consider smaller initial position to test market dynamics. Check if similar meme markets have resolved correctly in the past on this platform.\n\n✓ **close_position 6d9fd368-44c1-435e-8585-a03e3f1f3280** (88% quality)\n   Insight: Leverage violations override unrealized gains - compliance first, profits second.\n   Better: Consider partial close instead of full exit - could close 60% to lock profits while letting 40% ride with tighter stop. This balances profit protection with upside capture if momentum reverses.\n\n✓ **sell af0b241a-8b56-42b6-aa21-524f7a878e69** (88% quality)\n   Insight: 50% gains in Fear market = exit immediately, don't deliberate 14 times\n   Better: Implement automated profit-taking at predefined thresholds (e.g., 40% gain triggers partial exit) to avoid decision fatigue from 14 manual attempts. Set time-based exits for positions during Fear conditions rather than repeated deliberation.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 82% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: selection, risk, execution, sizing, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
