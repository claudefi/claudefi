(conf: 0.88)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Extreme RSI readings in downtrends often get more extreme before reversing\n- After 3 failed exits, diagnose execution issues before retrying the same approach\n- In extreme fear, 25% gains are rare gifts - take them before overnight risk materializes.\n- Never enter positions where your estimate contradicts the trade direction - edge sign matters.\n- After 2 failed exits, diagnose the failure mode before retry #3\n\n### Warnings to Heed\n\n*These patterns led to poor decisions recently:*\n\n- open_long ZEC: Catching falling knives based solely on RSI extremes is a low-probability strategy. RSI of 16.9 can stay oversold for extended periods in strong downtrends. 11% below EMA20 suggests strong bearish momentum, not a buying opportunity. No consideration of support levels, volume, or broader market context.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent persistence in executing profit-taking strategy despite multiple failed attempts. Strong risk management rationale - locking in 23% gains during extreme fear market conditions. Clear documentation of decision thesis and recognition that execution issues may need investigation.\n- sell : Strong risk management discipline - locking in 24.64% gain during extreme fear (28) aligns perfectly with conservative directive. Persistence through 8 failed attempts shows commitment to the exit thesis. Good recognition that overnight holds in bearish macro are risky.\n- sell : Clear recognition of negative edge position (29% gap between market and estimate). Correctly identifies this as a thesis violation from entry. Appropriately prioritizes position cleanup based on largest negative edge. Good persistence despite execution failures. Risk-aware reasoning considering market fear environment.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✗ **open_long ZEC** (35% quality)\n   Insight: Extreme RSI readings in downtrends often get more extreme before reversing\n   Better: Wait for RSI divergence or first signs of momentum reversal rather than anticipating the bounce. Look for price stabilization with volume confirmation. Consider ZEC's historical bounce patterns from similar RSI levels. Use limit orders at key support levels instead of market entry.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: After 3 failed exits, diagnose execution issues before retrying the same approach\n   Better: After 3-4 failed exits, investigate execution layer issues directly. Consider partial position exits, adjust slippage tolerance, or use limit orders instead of market orders. Escalate technical issues to system diagnostics rather than repeatedly attempting the same action.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: In extreme fear, 25% gains are rare gifts - take them before overnight risk materializes.\n   Better: Set a trailing stop or scaled exit strategy after first exit attempt failed. Could have used limit orders at specific levels rather than repeated market sell attempts. Define clearer criteria for when strong momentum justifies holding longer despite macro fear.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 79% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: timing, execution, selection, risk\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
