(conf: 0.95)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Pre-trade checklists prevent directional errors; apply BEFORE entry, not after 99% loss.\n- In fear markets, exit at first sign of momentum cooling - don't wait for perfect top.\n- Two-stage exits in fear markets: partial at target, close remainder quickly.\n- Lock profits at +25% in fear markets - partial sells preserve upside while managing downside.\n- Pre-trade checklist: verify position direction matches probability thesis before execution.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent application of learned lesson - using pre-trade checklist to identify directional mismatch between probability thesis (35%) and position (YES). Strong risk management discipline in cutting a -99.9% losing position. Clear reasoning about why the position was wrong (35% estimate vs 70% market = should be NO, not YES).\n- sell : Solid risk management approach - taking profits near target in a fear market (Fear Index 28). Good recognition of cooling momentum (pullback from +26.51% to +24.18%). Consistent with previous exit strategy and coordinator's conservative directive.\n- sell : Excellent execution of a two-stage profit-taking strategy. First partial sell at +25.51%, then closing remainder at +26.51%. Properly aligned with conservative coordinator directive and fear market conditions. Good risk management by not being greedy in extreme fear environment (Fear Index 28).\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Pre-trade checklists prevent directional errors; apply BEFORE entry, not after 99% loss.\n   Better: Implement mandatory pre-trade checklist BEFORE entry, not just as a correction mechanism. The checklist caught this error but only after catastrophic loss. Position direction verification should be step 1 of any trade execution.\n\n✓ **sell ** (78% quality)\n   Insight: In fear markets, exit at first sign of momentum cooling - don't wait for perfect top.\n   Better: Set tiered exit targets (e.g., 50% at +20%, 50% at +30%) to capture more upside while still locking in gains. Use trailing stops rather than fixed percentage targets in trending positions.\n\n✓ **sell ** (82% quality)\n   Insight: Two-stage exits in fear markets: partial at target, close remainder quickly.\n   Better: Consider a three-stage exit: 50% at +25%, 40% at target, keep 10% moonbag with tight stop. This preserves some upside if momentum continues while still locking majority of profits.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 81% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, timing, risk, sizing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
