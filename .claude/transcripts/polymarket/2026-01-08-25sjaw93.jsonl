(conf: 0.95)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (POLYMARKET)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate - 8% conviction means sell NO, not buy YES.\n- Break-even after 43% pump signals bad entry - focus on improving entry timing.\n- Fear market discipline: exit at 44% when rules say 33% - don't question the framework.\n- Pre-trade direction verification: estimate vs market → determines YES/NO side automatically\n- Fear markets (F&G<30) reward quick exits at 33%+; discipline beats greed.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Correctly identifies the need to cut losses on a position that violated entry criteria. Good recognition that the original trade was a directional error (8% estimate vs 50% entry price). Appropriate prioritization of capital allocation efficiency over sunk cost fallacy. Clear application of previous judge feedback about pre-trade direction verification.\n- sell : Excellent discipline following conservative framework in fear market. Correctly identified that break-even exits preserve capital. Good recognition of exit liquidity (64% buy ratio, $2M volume). Properly applied prior judge feedback about fear market exits.\n- sell : Excellent application of fear market profit-taking rules. +44.68% gain in 24h significantly exceeds the 33% threshold for quick exits. Strong reasoning around overnight hold risk and capital preservation. High confidence matches the clear alignment with established framework. Good recognition of exit liquidity (64% buy ratio).\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate - 8% conviction means sell NO, not buy YES.\n   Better: The better approach was at entry: never enter a position where your estimate (8%) dramatically contradicts the market price (50%) without understanding why. If conviction was 8%, the trade should have been NO, not YES. Position sizing should have been minimal given the uncertainty.\n\n✓ **sell ** (78% quality)\n   Insight: Break-even after 43% pump signals bad entry - focus on improving entry timing.\n   Better: A trailing stop at -10% from position high would have either: (1) locked in gains if entry was earlier, or (2) auto-exited if entry was at peak, avoiding decision fatigue.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Fear market discipline: exit at 44% when rules say 33% - don't question the framework.\n   Better: Consider scaling out 60-70% at this level while trailing stop on remainder. In fear markets with strong momentum tokens (+40%+), a trailing exit can capture residual upside while protecting most gains.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 78% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: selection, timing, risk, execution\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
