Strong application of previous judge feedback about decision paralysis. Clear articulation of reasons: freeing position slot, stopping capital bleed, avoiding sunk cost fallacy. High confidence appropriate for cleanup decision.\n- sell : Excellent execution discipline - applied learned rule immediately without hesitation. Clear rule: 30%+ gain in fear market = auto-exit. Strong liquidity verification ($231K, 63% buy ratio) ensures clean exit. Explicitly referenced previous judge feedback and corrected past hesitation patterns. Conservative mandate properly prioritized.\n- sell : Excellent execution of risk management principles. 35%+ gain captured in fear market (F&G: 28) aligns perfectly with conservative mandate. Strong conviction (95%) with clear reasoning. Verified exit liquidity ($230K, 63% buy ratio) before executing. Demonstrated discipline by following explicit rule: 30%+ gain in fear market = auto-exit.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Never enter positions at 6x your estimated fair value - entry discipline prevents cleanup pain.\n   Better: The better approach was never entering this trade. For cleanup: execute immediately without extensive reasoning - the decision is obvious. Future prevention: implement max loss thresholds (e.g., exit at 80% loss automatically) to avoid positions reaching 99.9% drawdown.\n\n✓ **sell ** (94% quality)\n   Insight: 37%+ gain in fear market with strong liquidity = immediate execution, zero hesitation\n   Better: Decision is sound - the only enhancement would be logging exact entry/exit prices and hold duration for future pattern refinement. Consider adding sentiment trajectory (fear increasing/decreasing) to exit timing.\n\n✓ **sell ** (92% quality)\n   Insight: Clear rules demand immediate execution - hesitation on attempt 5 means 4 wasted signals.\n   Better: Implement automated trigger for 30%+ gains in fear markets to eliminate hesitation. First signal should have been execution - the rule was clear. Consider tiered exit strategy (e.g., 50% at 30%, remainder with trailing stop).\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 86% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: selection, execution, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
