(conf: 0.68)\n- open_long SUI: SUI shows extreme oversold conditions with RSI at ... (conf: 0.72)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (PERPS)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- A -100% exit is autopsy, not surgery. Stop-losses must trigger before total loss.\n- 33%+ gains in F&G 28 = full exit justified; fear markets punish greed quickly\n- A -100% loss exit is not risk management - it's damage acknowledgment. Stop-losses must trigger earlier.\n- Always verify trade direction matches your probability thesis BEFORE entry, not after.\n- Lock 80%+ of gains at target in fear markets; let 20% ride with tight stop\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Correct decision to exit a catastrophically losing position. Recognition that salvaging any remaining value is better than holding through continued decline. Alignment with conservative risk mandate and avoiding overnight exposure in bearish conditions.\n- sell DINO: Excellent application of learned patterns: securing 33%+ gains in fear market conditions (F&G 28) aligns perfectly with judge guidance to lock 80%+ of gains. Strong adherence to coordinator's CONSERVATIVE directive and avoiding overnight holds. Building on previous successful sell decision at +31.49%.\n- sell : Appropriate application of stop-loss discipline in fear market conditions. Recognized catastrophic loss scenario and prioritized capital preservation over hopeful recovery. Decision aligned with coordinator guidance for quick exits in bearish environment.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (55% quality)\n   Insight: A -100% exit is autopsy, not surgery. Stop-losses must trigger before total loss.\n   Better: Implement strict stop-losses at entry that trigger at 15-25% loss maximum. The real decision point was ignored - this should have been exited much earlier when losses were recoverable. Post-mortem should focus on why position was held to -100%.\n\n✓ **sell DINO** (87% quality)\n   Insight: 33%+ gains in F&G 28 = full exit justified; fear markets punish greed quickly\n   Better: Consider tiered exit strategy: sell 70% immediately to lock core profits, set trailing stop on remaining 30% to capture momentum continuation while protecting downside. This balances capital preservation with upside participation.\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: A -100% loss exit is not risk management - it's damage acknowledgment. Stop-losses must trigger earlier.\n   Better: Implement stricter stop-losses at 20-30% drawdown rather than allowing positions to reach -100%. In fear markets with F&G at 28, tighter risk controls should be automatic. Early warning systems for rapidly declining assets like SPARK (-54.53% in 24h) should trigger exits before catastrophic losses.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 80% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: risk, selection, execution, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.

SUI is at RSI 18.5 - extreme oversold territory that often precedes bounces\n2. SUI has negative funding rate (-0.0008%) - shorts are paying longs, favorable\n3. Positions were entered at oversold conditions and thesis is still valid\n4. No actual loss data visible to trigger stop-loss exit\n\n**Why Hold (not add):**\n1. CONSERVATIVE directive from coordinator\n2. Bearish momentum across all markets\n3. Fear & Greed at 28 - significant fear\n4. Already have 2 positions open (max 3)\n5. Judge feedback emphasizes early exits on losses, not adding to risk\n\n### Monitoring Triggers:\n- Will exit if positions show >15-20% loss on next cycle\n- Will exit if momentum continues bearish and RSI stays low without bounce\n- Following judge guidance: \"Stop-losses must trigger before total loss\""}],"metadata":{"domain":"perps","model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","tokensUsed":324}}
