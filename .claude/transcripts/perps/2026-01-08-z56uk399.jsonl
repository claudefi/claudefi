Agent recognized the directional error (holding YES with 8% estimate vs 49% market = should be on NO side), applied learned skill about direction verification, and took decisive action to exit the wrong-way position. Demonstrates adaptive learning and proper risk management by cutting losses.\n- open_long ENA: Strong technical setup identification with RSI at extreme oversold levels (11.6). Conservative leverage at 3x appropriate for altcoin volatility. Good position sizing at 14% of balance, well within risk limits. Clear comparison to previous successful SUI trade pattern. Defined exit targets and mental stop loss.\n- sell : Excellent self-correction behavior. Agent recognized a critical directional error (bought YES at 49% when estimate was 8%) and immediately moved to close the position. Shows learning from previous judge feedback about pre-trade direction verification. High confidence (95%) appropriate for clear error correction.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Always verify trade direction matches your probability thesis before execution.\n   Better: Implement pre-trade checklist: 1) State probability estimate, 2) Identify which side (YES/NO) that estimate favors, 3) Verify order direction matches. For extreme predictions like Bitcoin $1M, require additional confirmation before entry.\n\n✓ **open_long ENA** (72% quality)\n   Insight: Extreme RSI + existing position = reduce size to manage correlation risk\n   Better: Consider reducing position size to $200-250 given existing SUI exposure and ENA's higher volatility profile. Add volume confirmation before entry - ensure buying volume is increasing. Check for any upcoming token unlocks or governance events specific to ENA.\n\n✓ **sell ** (92% quality)\n   Insight: Direction verification before trade entry prevents costly reversal trades.\n   Better: After closing, immediately implement a pre-trade checklist: 'My estimate is X%, market is Y%, so I buy [YES/NO] because...' This mandatory verification would have prevented the original error entirely.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 79% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, sizing, timing, market_read, risk\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
