(conf: 0.75)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (SPOT)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- 27% gain in fear market = exit now, don't wait for 30% perfection.\n- 30%+ gains in fear markets are rare - exit before greed overrides discipline.\n- +34% in fear market is a gift - take profits, don't get greedy.\n- When you realize you're wrong, exit immediately - don't hope for rescue.\n- Break-even exits after chasing pumps in fear markets are wins - preserve capital for better entries\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent pattern recognition and discipline. Agent correctly identified approaching the 30% threshold in a FEAR market, applied learned historical patterns about exiting before greed takes over, acknowledged prior sell attempts showing consistent intent, and properly assessed liquidity for clean exit. Strong alignment with CONSERVATIVE directive and coordinator guidance on quick exits.\n- sell : Excellent pattern recognition - applied prior judge feedback about profit-taking at similar gain levels. Strong discipline in following conservative mandate during fear market (F&G 28). Good awareness of overnight hold risk and exit liquidity conditions. The reasoning explicitly references learned patterns, showing adaptive behavior.\n- sell : Excellent discipline in following CONSERVATIVE directive during FEAR market conditions. Locking in +34% gain aligns perfectly with guidance for quick entries/exits. Proper consideration of liquidity ($221K) for clean exit. Good risk management by avoiding overnight hold in bearish environment.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (88% quality)\n   Insight: 27% gain in fear market = exit now, don't wait for 30% perfection.\n   Better: Set hard exit targets at entry (e.g., 25% gain in fear markets) rather than approaching thresholds reactively. Could implement trailing stops mentally or in execution to capture gains without repeated manual sell attempts.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: 30%+ gains in fear markets are rare - exit before greed overrides discipline.\n   Better: Consider implementing tiered exits - selling 70-80% at +30% while trailing a small portion with tight stops in case momentum continues. This captures bulk profits while allowing participation in potential further upside.\n\n✓ **sell ** (82% quality)\n   Insight: +34% in fear market is a gift - take profits, don't get greedy.\n   Better: Consider partial exit strategy - sell 70-80% to lock profits while keeping small position for potential continued momentum. Set clear re-entry criteria if DINO consolidates at key support levels.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 82% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: timing, risk, selection, execution\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.

Key factors: (1) CONSERVATIVE directive mandates quick exits in fear markets, (2) Judge feedback explicitly states \"30%+ gains in fear markets are rare - exit before greed overrides discipline\" and \"27% gain in fear market = exit now\", (3) Fear & Greed at 28 indicates significant fear - locking in gains is essential, (4) $220K liquidity ensures clean exit for $455 position. No more waiting - taking profits now per all learned patterns.","confidence":0.92}},"metadata":{"domain":"spot","toolName":"submit_decision"}}
