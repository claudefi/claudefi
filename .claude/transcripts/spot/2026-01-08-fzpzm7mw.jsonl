(conf: 0.78)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (SPOT)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- 30%+ gains in fear markets are rare - exit before greed overrides discipline.\n- +34% in fear market is a gift - take profits, don't get greedy.\n- When you realize you're wrong, exit immediately - don't hope for rescue.\n- Break-even exits after chasing pumps in fear markets are wins - preserve capital for better entries\n- Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate - 8% conviction means sell NO, not buy YES.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent pattern recognition - applied prior judge feedback about profit-taking at similar gain levels. Strong discipline in following conservative mandate during fear market (F&G 28). Good awareness of overnight hold risk and exit liquidity conditions. The reasoning explicitly references learned patterns, showing adaptive behavior.\n- sell : Excellent discipline in following CONSERVATIVE directive during FEAR market conditions. Locking in +34% gain aligns perfectly with guidance for quick entries/exits. Proper consideration of liquidity ($221K) for clean exit. Good risk management by avoiding overnight hold in bearish environment.\n- sell : Excellent self-correction and discipline. Recognized the original trade was mis-positioned against own probability estimate (35% vs buying YES). Applied learned insight from previous feedback ('Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate'). Properly identified the 26% edge was for NO, not YES. Good risk awareness in fear market (F&G 28).\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: 30%+ gains in fear markets are rare - exit before greed overrides discipline.\n   Better: Consider implementing tiered exits - selling 70-80% at +30% while trailing a small portion with tight stops in case momentum continues. This captures bulk profits while allowing participation in potential further upside.\n\n✓ **sell ** (82% quality)\n   Insight: +34% in fear market is a gift - take profits, don't get greedy.\n   Better: Consider partial exit strategy - sell 70-80% to lock profits while keeping small position for potential continued momentum. Set clear re-entry criteria if DINO consolidates at key support levels.\n\n✓ **sell ** (82% quality)\n   Insight: When you realize you're wrong, exit immediately - don't hope for rescue.\n   Better: Prevention > cure. At entry, always explicitly state: 'My probability is X%, market is Y%, therefore I should buy [YES/NO] because [X > Y means YES is underpriced / X < Y means NO is underpriced]'. This verbal protocol prevents directional errors.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 81% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: timing, risk, selection, execution\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
