(conf: 0.82)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (SPOT)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- 23%+ memecoin gains in fear markets + conservative mandate = immediate full exit, no hesitation.\n- 26%+ memecoin gains in fear markets with overnight risk = full exit, don't negotiate with profits\n- In fear markets, 26%+ memecoin gains with overnight risk warrant full exits over partial.\n- In fear markets, full profit-taking on 30%+ gains beats partial exits - velocity matters.\n- Exit discipline matters as much as entry discipline - set loss thresholds upfront.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent discipline executing conservative directive. 23.45% gain locked in during fear market (F&G 28). Strong alignment with prior judge feedback on full exits at 20%+ gains. Properly assessed liquidity ($223K) as adequate for clean exit. Overnight risk mitigation in bearish conditions shows mature risk management.\n- sell : Excellent discipline in executing profit-taking aligned with conservative directive. Strong risk management rationale - Fear & Greed at 28 combined with overnight hold risk makes full exit prudent. +26% gain on memecoin is substantial. Good synthesis of previous judge feedback and coordinator directives. Volume and liquidity analysis supports clean exit execution.\n- sell : Excellent alignment with coordinator's CONSERVATIVE directive and fear market conditions. Strong reasoning chain connecting macro sentiment (F&G 28) with memecoin correlation risk. Referenced previous judge feedback appropriately. 26.89% gain in 24h is substantial and locking it in during bearish conditions demonstrates discipline.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (91% quality)\n   Insight: 23%+ memecoin gains in fear markets + conservative mandate = immediate full exit, no hesitation.\n   Better: Decision was well-executed for conservative mandate. Only marginal improvement would be documenting exact hold duration and considering a trailing stop for the final 10-15% of position if buy ratio truly remained elevated.\n\n✓ **sell ** (88% quality)\n   Insight: 26%+ memecoin gains in fear markets with overnight risk = full exit, don't negotiate with profits\n   Better: Consider implementing tiered exit strategy - 70% exit to lock profits, 30% trailing stop for additional upside capture. Set re-entry criteria based on specific price levels or sentiment shifts rather than blanket exit.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: In fear markets, 26%+ memecoin gains with overnight risk warrant full exits over partial.\n   Better: Given $223K liquidity and strong volume, could have considered a staged exit (80% immediate, 20% trailing stop) to capture potential upside while still locking in majority of gains. However, full exit is defensible given explicit conservative mandate.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 85% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: timing, risk, execution, selection\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
