(conf: 0.9)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (SPOT)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Fear markets (F&G<30) reward quick exits at 33%+; discipline beats greed.\n- Pre-trade checklists prevent expensive directional errors; post-entry is too late.\n- Break-even exits in fear markets are wins - capital preserved beats hope.\n- Directional errors demand same-day reversal, not end-of-life cleanup.\n- A -100% exit is autopsy, not surgery. Stop-losses must trigger before total loss.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent risk management in fear market (F&G 28). Following conservative mandate by locking in +42.9% gain rather than holding for more. Clear reasoning citing previous judge feedback about full exits at 33%+ gains in fear conditions. Good awareness of overnight risk and capital preservation priority.\n- sell : Excellent self-correction and learning from previous judge feedback. Clear recognition of the directional error pattern (estimate < market should = BUY NO). Proper risk management mindset - cutting losses in a fear market with conservative directive. Good articulation of the original mistake and current rationale.\n- sell : Excellent risk discipline by following coordinator's CONSERVATIVE directive and avoiding overnight holds in fear market. Good pattern recognition referencing previous successful DINO exit. Rational decision to preserve capital at break-even rather than gambling on continued momentum.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (88% quality)\n   Insight: Fear markets (F&G<30) reward quick exits at 33%+; discipline beats greed.\n   Better: Decision was well-aligned with conservative framework. Could slightly improve by documenting exact exit price and time-in-trade for pattern recognition on optimal holding periods in fear markets.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Pre-trade checklists prevent expensive directional errors; post-entry is too late.\n   Better: Implement a pre-trade checklist that forces explicit verification: 'My estimate is X%, market is Y%, therefore I should buy [YES/NO]'. Add position monitoring that flags directional mismatches immediately after entry.\n\n✓ **sell ** (78% quality)\n   Insight: Break-even exits in fear markets are wins - capital preserved beats hope.\n   Better: Set trailing stops on positions showing significant gains (+36%) to lock in profits automatically rather than letting them erode back to break-even. The strong buy ratio (65%) could have justified a tighter trailing stop rather than manual monitoring.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 80% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: timing, execution, risk, selection\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
