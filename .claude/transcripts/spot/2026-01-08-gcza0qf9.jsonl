(conf: 0.99)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (SPOT)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Never enter when market price exceeds your probability estimate - that's buying negative edge.\n- After 3 failed executions, diagnose root cause before retry - don't just repeat.\n- Review new positions within 24hrs to catch thesis violations before they compound.\n- Repeated execution failures need root cause analysis, not just retry attempts.\n- 32% gain in fear market = exit immediately, but debug execution failures after 2 attempts\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Strong self-accountability in acknowledging the original thesis violation. Correct prioritization of portfolio cleanup before new trades. Good recognition that entry was fundamentally flawed (bought YES at 50% with 35% probability estimate). Persistence in attempting to exit despite previous failures.\n- sell DINO: Persistent execution despite multiple failures. Clear risk management rationale aligned with CONSERVATIVE mandate. Strong reasoning citing specific metrics: liquidity, volume, buy ratio. Correct interpretation of Fear market conditions requiring profit-taking.\n- sell : Clear acknowledgment of initial entry error (buying YES at 50% when estimate was 35%). Good discipline in cleaning up a flawed position despite psychological difficulty of realizing losses. Proper documentation of the original thesis violation.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Never enter when market price exceeds your probability estimate - that's buying negative edge.\n   Better: Should have implemented hard stop-loss rules at entry time. When entry thesis is violated (buying YES at 50% with 35% estimate), immediate exit within same session should be mandatory. Consider using limit orders at slightly below market to ensure execution if previous market orders failed.\n\n✓ **sell DINO** (85% quality)\n   Insight: After 3 failed executions, diagnose root cause before retry - don't just repeat.\n   Better: After 2-3 failed exits, should diagnose the failure mode before continuing. Check if position still exists, verify API connectivity, consider partial exits if full exit fails, or flag for manual intervention.\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Review new positions within 24hrs to catch thesis violations before they compound.\n   Better: Should have recognized the thesis violation within hours/days of entry and exited immediately, or better yet, never entered the position. Implement position review within 24-48 hours of any entry to validate edge alignment.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 87% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: selection, execution, risk\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio. Make a decision.\n\n1. Use fetch tools to get current market data\n2. Analyze opportunities and risks\n3. Use submit_decision to record your action\n\nYou MUST call submit_decision with your final decision.\n","metadata":{"domain":"spot"}}
