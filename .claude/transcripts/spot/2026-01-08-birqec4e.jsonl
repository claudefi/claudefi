Stop-losses must trigger before total loss.\n- 33%+ gains in F&G 28 = full exit justified; fear markets punish greed quickly\n- A -100% loss exit is not risk management - it's damage acknowledgment. Stop-losses must trigger earlier.\n- Always verify trade direction matches your probability thesis BEFORE entry, not after.\n- Lock 80%+ of gains at target in fear markets; let 20% ride with tight stop\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Correct decision to exit a catastrophically losing position. Recognition that salvaging any remaining value is better than holding through continued decline. Alignment with conservative risk mandate and avoiding overnight exposure in bearish conditions.\n- sell DINO: Excellent application of learned patterns: securing 33%+ gains in fear market conditions (F&G 28) aligns perfectly with judge guidance to lock 80%+ of gains. Strong adherence to coordinator's CONSERVATIVE directive and avoiding overnight holds. Building on previous successful sell decision at +31.49%.\n- sell : Appropriate application of stop-loss discipline in fear market conditions. Recognized catastrophic loss scenario and prioritized capital preservation over hopeful recovery. Decision aligned with coordinator guidance for quick exits in bearish environment.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (55% quality)\n   Insight: A -100% exit is autopsy, not surgery. Stop-losses must trigger before total loss.\n   Better: Implement strict stop-losses at entry that trigger at 15-25% loss maximum. The real decision point was ignored - this should have been exited much earlier when losses were recoverable. Post-mortem should focus on why position was held to -100%.\n\n✓ **sell DINO** (87% quality)\n   Insight: 33%+ gains in F&G 28 = full exit justified; fear markets punish greed quickly\n   Better: Consider tiered exit strategy: sell 70% immediately to lock core profits, set trailing stop on remaining 30% to capture momentum continuation while protecting downside. This balances capital preservation with upside participation.\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: A -100% loss exit is not risk management - it's damage acknowledgment. Stop-losses must trigger earlier.\n   Better: Implement stricter stop-losses at 20-30% drawdown rather than allowing positions to reach -100%. In fear markets with F&G at 28, tighter risk controls should be automatic. Early warning systems for rapidly declining assets like SPARK (-54.53% in 24h) should trigger exits before catastrophic losses.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 80% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: risk, selection, execution, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.

This indicates the token has momentum. However:\n\n- Market sentiment is BEARISH (F&G 28)\n- Coordinator says CONSERVATIVE with quick exits\n- Judge repeatedly says to lock in gains in fear markets\n\nGiven that the position shows $350 entry and $350 current (no realized gains yet in this specific position), but DINO itself is up +36.37% in 24h, I should consider:\n\n1. The position was likely opened recently and is flat\n2. DINO still has strong momentum (65% buy ratio)\n3. But fear markets punish greed - the +36% pump could reverse quickly\n\n**Recommendation:** Since the current position is at break-even and DINO shows continued strength with high buy pressure (65%), I could hold briefly BUT given the conservative directive and bearish market, the safer move is to exit at break-even rather than risk a loss overnight.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - the position shows $350 entry = $350 current, meaning I'm at break-even. The token is up 36% over 24h which means there was momentum, but my specific entry may have been at a higher point. Given conservative guidance, I should exit to protect capital."},{"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_014brAKTiSTwTbeQRHMf2FUV","name":"submit_decision","input":{"action":"sell","position_id":"2e65bf74-b1da-4d92-91fc-85284b09744e","reasoning":"Exiting DINO position at break-even ($350 entry = $350 current).
