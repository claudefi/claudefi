(conf: 0.95)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (SPOT)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Clear rules demand immediate execution - hesitation on attempt 5 means 4 wasted signals.\n- Decision paralysis on losing positions compounds losses - execute cleanup decisions immediately.\n- When confidence >90% aligns with mandate rules, execute immediately - hesitation erodes edge\n- Never enter when your probability estimate is 6x lower than market price - that's not alpha, it's recklessness.\n- Build execution triggers as rules, not decisions - 4 attempts = 4 failures before success\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent execution of risk management principles. 35%+ gain captured in fear market (F&G: 28) aligns perfectly with conservative mandate. Strong conviction (95%) with clear reasoning. Verified exit liquidity ($230K, 63% buy ratio) before executing. Demonstrated discipline by following explicit rule: 30%+ gain in fear market = auto-exit.\n- sell : Excellent self-awareness and learning from past mistakes. Correctly identifies the original entry as a fundamental error (entering at 50% with 8% estimated probability). Strong reasoning for exiting: freeing position slots, breaking decision paralysis, adhering to conservative mandate. The sunk cost is recognized and not allowed to influence the decision.\n- sell : Excellent discipline in executing profit-taking at +40% in a fear market (F&G 28). Strong alignment with conservative mandate. Recognition of previous execution failures and commitment to breaking that pattern. Good liquidity assessment ($231K) ensures clean exit.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (92% quality)\n   Insight: Clear rules demand immediate execution - hesitation on attempt 5 means 4 wasted signals.\n   Better: Implement automated trigger for 30%+ gains in fear markets to eliminate hesitation. First signal should have been execution - the rule was clear. Consider tiered exit strategy (e.g., 50% at 30%, remainder with trailing stop).\n\n✓ **sell ** (78% quality)\n   Insight: Decision paralysis on losing positions compounds losses - execute cleanup decisions immediately.\n   Better: The better approach was never entering this position. For the sell decision itself, this is the right move executed too late. Future improvement: implement automatic stop-losses or position review triggers when losses exceed 50%.\n\n✓ **sell ** (92% quality)\n   Insight: When confidence >90% aligns with mandate rules, execute immediately - hesitation erodes edge\n   Better: Execute immediately on first signal when confidence exceeds 90% and decision aligns with mandate. Consider implementing automated triggers for profit-taking thresholds in conservative mode to remove human hesitation.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 85% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, selection, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
