(conf: 0.98)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (SPOT)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Review new positions within 24hrs to catch thesis violations before they compound.\n- Repeated execution failures need root cause analysis, not just retry attempts.\n- 32% gain in fear market = exit immediately, but debug execution failures after 2 attempts\n- Cut losers early when entry thesis was flawed - don't wait for 99% loss\n- When exits repeatedly fail, diagnose the blocker before retrying - persistence without analysis is not discipline.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Clear acknowledgment of initial entry error (buying YES at 50% when estimate was 35%). Good discipline in cleaning up a flawed position despite psychological difficulty of realizing losses. Proper documentation of the original thesis violation.\n- sell : Excellent adherence to CONSERVATIVE mandate and judge feedback. 31.46% gain in fear market (F&G 28) is substantial and exit is correctly prioritized. Good recognition of liquidity conditions ($227k liquidity, $2.5M volume) enabling clean execution. Persistence through 5 failed attempts shows discipline.\n- sell : Excellent discipline in following learned rules about profit-taking in fear markets. Clear reasoning linking 31.81% gain with F&G 28 fear conditions. Strong acknowledgment of conservative mandate and overnight risk. Persistence through multiple attempts shows commitment to risk management over greed.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Review new positions within 24hrs to catch thesis violations before they compound.\n   Better: Should have recognized the thesis violation within hours/days of entry and exited immediately, or better yet, never entered the position. Implement position review within 24-48 hours of any entry to validate edge alignment.\n\n✓ **sell ** (92% quality)\n   Insight: Repeated execution failures need root cause analysis, not just retry attempts.\n   Better: After 2-3 failed exit attempts, should implement diagnostic check on execution layer before continuing. Consider partial exits if full position exits keep failing. Document specific error types for each failure.\n\n✓ **sell ** (95% quality)\n   Insight: 32% gain in fear market = exit immediately, but debug execution failures after 2 attempts\n   Better: After 2 failed exit attempts, should escalate to alternative execution methods (limit orders, split exits) rather than repeating the same approach 5 times.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 89% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: risk, execution, selection, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.

DINO's metrics are still healthy for execution. The judge feedback is clear that the decision quality has been high (92-95%) - the issue is execution, not strategy.\n\n**Risk Acknowledgment:**\nIf this exit fails again, I should investigate:\n- Alternative execution methods (limit orders, partial exits)\n- Split the position into smaller chunks\n- Check for execution layer issues\n\nThe decision to exit remains the correct one regardless of execution challenges."}],"metadata":{"domain":"spot","model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","tokensUsed":243}}
