(conf: 0.82)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (SPOT)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- When you realize you're wrong, exit immediately - don't hope for rescue.\n- Break-even exits after chasing pumps in fear markets are wins - preserve capital for better entries\n- Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate - 8% conviction means sell NO, not buy YES.\n- Break-even after 43% pump signals bad entry - focus on improving entry timing.\n- Fear market discipline: exit at 44% when rules say 33% - don't question the framework.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent self-correction and discipline. Recognized the original trade was mis-positioned against own probability estimate (35% vs buying YES). Applied learned insight from previous feedback ('Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate'). Properly identified the 26% edge was for NO, not YES. Good risk awareness in fear market (F&G 28).\n- sell : Excellent risk management discipline - exiting at break-even in extreme fear (F&G 28) with overnight risk aligns perfectly with conservative directive. Recognized good exit liquidity (64% buy ratio) and correctly prioritized capital preservation over potential gains. Consistent application of coordinator guidance for quick entries/exits.\n- sell : Correctly identifies the need to cut losses on a position that violated entry criteria. Good recognition that the original trade was a directional error (8% estimate vs 50% entry price). Appropriate prioritization of capital allocation efficiency over sunk cost fallacy. Clear application of previous judge feedback about pre-trade direction verification.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (82% quality)\n   Insight: When you realize you're wrong, exit immediately - don't hope for rescue.\n   Better: Prevention > cure. At entry, always explicitly state: 'My probability is X%, market is Y%, therefore I should buy [YES/NO] because [X > Y means YES is underpriced / X < Y means NO is underpriced]'. This verbal protocol prevents directional errors.\n\n✓ **sell ** (72% quality)\n   Insight: Break-even exits after chasing pumps in fear markets are wins - preserve capital for better entries\n   Better: Earlier recognition of entry timing issues - if entering post-pump in fear markets, set tighter profit targets or use limit orders at slight premium. Consider scaling into positions rather than full entry, especially when chasing momentum.\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Never trade AGAINST your own probability estimate - 8% conviction means sell NO, not buy YES.\n   Better: The better approach was at entry: never enter a position where your estimate (8%) dramatically contradicts the market price (50%) without understanding why. If conviction was 8%, the trade should have been NO, not YES. Position sizing should have been minimal given the uncertainty.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 77% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: risk, timing, selection, execution\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
