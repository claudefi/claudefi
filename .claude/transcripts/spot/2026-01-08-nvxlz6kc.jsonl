(conf: 0.95)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (SPOT)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- 32% gain in fear market = exit immediately, but debug execution failures after 2 attempts\n- Cut losers early when entry thesis was flawed - don't wait for 99% loss\n- When exits repeatedly fail, diagnose the blocker before retrying - persistence without analysis is not discipline.\n- Never enter when market price implies 6x your probability estimate - the edge must exist at entry.\n- Hesitation past 20% gains in fear markets is gambling, not strategy - automate exits.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent discipline in following learned rules about profit-taking in fear markets. Clear reasoning linking 31.81% gain with F&G 28 fear conditions. Strong acknowledgment of conservative mandate and overnight risk. Persistence through multiple attempts shows commitment to risk management over greed.\n- sell : Excellent self-awareness and learning from past mistakes. Correctly identified that the original entry violated fundamental edge principles (entering at 50% when estimate was 8%). Taking decisive action to clean up bad positions rather than hoping for recovery. Proper risk management in bearish conditions by reducing exposure.\n- sell : Excellent discipline and learning from previous feedback. Clear recognition of multiple risk factors: memecoin volatility, fear market conditions, conservative mandate violation, and adequate liquidity for exit. The 98% confidence reflects appropriate conviction after multiple failed attempts. Correctly prioritized rule execution over profit maximization.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (95% quality)\n   Insight: 32% gain in fear market = exit immediately, but debug execution failures after 2 attempts\n   Better: After 2 failed exit attempts, should escalate to alternative execution methods (limit orders, split exits) rather than repeating the same approach 5 times.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Cut losers early when entry thesis was flawed - don't wait for 99% loss\n   Better: Should have exited much earlier when it became clear entry violated edge requirements. Better yet, implement pre-trade checklist that catches edge violations before entry. Consider if transaction fees exceed the $0.50 position value.\n\n✓ **sell ** (92% quality)\n   Insight: When exits repeatedly fail, diagnose the blocker before retrying - persistence without analysis is not discipline.\n   Better: After the second failed exit attempt, should have: 1) diagnosed the failure reason, 2) adjusted execution parameters if needed (smaller chunks, different timing), 3) documented the blocker for system improvement.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 89% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, risk, selection, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.

Position shows +31.46% gain based on current DINO price. Judge feedback is clear: \"32% gain in fear market = exit immediately.\" With F&G at 28 (Fear) and CONSERVATIVE mandate requiring quick exits and avoiding overnight holds, this exit is mandatory. DINO has strong liquidity ($227k) and volume ($2.5M) so execution should be feasible. Previous 5 attempts failed but the trade thesis remains correct - we must take profits in fear markets. Will document execution failure patterns if this also fails for system improvement.","confidence":0.99}},"metadata":{"domain":"spot","toolName":"submit_decision"}}
