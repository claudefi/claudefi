(conf: 0.93)\n- sell 2e65bf74-b1da-4d92-91fc-85284b09744e: TWELFTH DINO EXIT ATTEMPT - LOCKING IN ~25% PROFIT... (conf: 0.92)\n- sell : ELEVENTH DINO EXIT ATTEMPT - MUST LOCK PROFITS. DI... (conf: 0.92)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (SPOT)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Lock in 50% gains during Fear conditions - sentiment can deteriorate rapidly overnight\n- Chasing 22%+ pumps often means buying near local top - wait for consolidation\n- Exit winners when technicals flip bearish; don't let profits become losses.\n- After 3 failed executions, diagnose the system before retrying blindly.\n- Exit extreme negative-edge positions first; 11x in 204 days needs extraordinary catalysts.\n\n### Warnings to Heed\n\n*These patterns led to poor decisions recently:*\n\n- open_long ZEC: Catching falling knives based solely on RSI extremes is a low-probability strategy. RSI of 16.9 can stay oversold for extended periods in strong downtrends. 11% below EMA20 suggests strong bearish momentum, not a buying opportunity. No consideration of support levels, volume, or broader market context.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell 36c1c0b4-7496-4650-8090-4d9ca55f63f3: Strong profit-taking discipline with 50% unrealized gain. Good liquidity verification ($213K > $50K threshold). Aligned with bearish market sentiment (Fear & Greed 28) and coordinator directive for conservative exits. Position sizing appropriate for clean exit.\n- buy 26M5M3nwgaKE4zavkD3zEtYs5hJWdxe6xBwpdtsLHy1o: Good liquidity analysis (4x above minimum threshold). Clear exit strategy with defined profit target (2x) and stop loss (-15%). Recognition of bullish sentiment via 60% buy ratio. Appropriate aggression for paper trading context.\n- close_position 041a513e-629d-4587-b9d8-5b829cfacffb: Excellent profit-taking discipline - locking in +15% gains ($30) when technical indicators confirm bearish momentum. Price below EMA20 and neutral RSI validate the exit timing. Decision aligns with previous judge feedback, showing learning adaptation.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell 36c1c0b4-7496-4650-8090-4d9ca55f63f3** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Lock in 50% gains during Fear conditions - sentiment can deteriorate rapidly overnight\n   Better: Decision logic is sound. The execution layer should have circuit breakers to prevent 13+ repeated decision cycles on the same trade. Consider implementing order status tracking to avoid redundant decision evaluations.\n\n✓ **buy 26M5M3nwgaKE4zavkD3zEtYs5hJWdxe6xBwpdtsLHy1o** (68% quality)\n   Insight: Chasing 22%+ pumps often means buying near local top - wait for consolidation\n   Better: Scale into position: 10% initial, add 10% on confirmation of continued strength. Wait for a pullback to enter rather than chasing +22% gain. Check holder distribution and recent large transactions. Set time-based exit if momentum stalls (e.g., exit if no further gains in 4 hours).\n\n✓ **close_position 041a513e-629d-4587-b9d8-5b829cfacffb** (82% quality)\n   Insight: Exit winners when technicals flip bearish; don't let profits become losses.\n   Better: Consider implementing a trailing stop or partial exit strategy - close 60-70% at current profit, let remainder ride with tight stop. This balances profit-taking with upside optionality.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 77% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: timing, execution, selection, risk\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
