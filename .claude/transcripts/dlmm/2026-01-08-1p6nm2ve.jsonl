Focus on high-TVL pools with strong fee generation.\n\n\n## Balance\n$2500.00 available for DLMM\n\n## Open Positions (0)\nNo open positions\n\n## Recent Decisions\nNo recent decisions\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (DLMM)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Lock 80%+ of gains at target in fear markets; let 20% ride with tight stop\n- Always verify: if your estimate < market price, you should be SHORT, not LONG.\n- Pre-trade checklists prevent directional errors; apply BEFORE entry, not after 99% loss.\n- In fear markets, exit at first sign of momentum cooling - don't wait for perfect top.\n- Two-stage exits in fear markets: partial at target, close remainder quickly.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell 26M5M3nwgaKE4zavkD3zEtYs5hJWdxe6xBwpdtsLHy1o: Excellent discipline in executing profit-taking strategy at +31.49% gain, well above the 25% target. Strong alignment with learned patterns and coordinator directives. Good risk management recognizing fear market conditions (F&G 28) create downside risk despite strong buy ratio.\n- sell : Excellent self-correction and error recognition. Identified directional mismatch between probability estimate (35%) and position (YES). Applied systematic pre-trade checklist retrospectively. Good prioritization by closing largest edge mismatch first. Aligned with risk rules (max 3 positions) and coordinator directives for fear market conditions.\n- sell : Excellent application of learned lesson - using pre-trade checklist to identify directional mismatch between probability thesis (35%) and position (YES). Strong risk management discipline in cutting a -99.9% losing position. Clear reasoning about why the position was wrong (35% estimate vs 70% market = should be NO, not YES).\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell 26M5M3nwgaKE4zavkD3zEtYs5hJWdxe6xBwpdtsLHy1o** (88% quality)\n   Insight: Lock 80%+ of gains at target in fear markets; let 20% ride with tight stop\n   Better: Consider implementing tiered exit strategy: 50% at +25%, 30% at +30%, trailing stop on remaining 20%. This captures the core profit while allowing for potential continued upside.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Always verify: if your estimate < market price, you should be SHORT, not LONG.\n   Better: Implement mandatory pre-trade checklist BEFORE entry: 'If my estimate is X% and market is Y%, which side has edge?' This simple verification prevents directional errors. Also consider automated alerts when position direction conflicts with probability estimates.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Pre-trade checklists prevent directional errors; apply BEFORE entry, not after 99% loss.\n   Better: Implement mandatory pre-trade checklist BEFORE entry, not just as a correction mechanism. The checklist caught this error but only after catastrophic loss. Position direction verification should be step 1 of any trade execution.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 83% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, timing, risk, sizing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio. Make a decision.\n\n1. Use fetch tools to get current market data\n2. Analyze opportunities and risks\n3. Use submit_decision to record your action\n\nYou MUST call submit_decision with your final decision.\n","metadata":{"domain":"dlmm"}}
