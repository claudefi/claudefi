Focus on high-TVL pools with strong fee generation.\n\n\n## Balance\n$2500.00 available for DLMM\n\n## Open Positions (0)\nNo open positions\n\n## Recent Decisions\nNo recent decisions\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (DLMM)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- A -100% exit is autopsy, not surgery. Stop-losses must trigger before total loss.\n- 33%+ gains in F&G 28 = full exit justified; fear markets punish greed quickly\n- A -100% loss exit is not risk management - it's damage acknowledgment. Stop-losses must trigger earlier.\n- Always verify trade direction matches your probability thesis BEFORE entry, not after.\n- Lock 80%+ of gains at target in fear markets; let 20% ride with tight stop\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Correct decision to exit a catastrophically losing position. Recognition that salvaging any remaining value is better than holding through continued decline. Alignment with conservative risk mandate and avoiding overnight exposure in bearish conditions.\n- sell DINO: Excellent application of learned patterns: securing 33%+ gains in fear market conditions (F&G 28) aligns perfectly with judge guidance to lock 80%+ of gains. Strong adherence to coordinator's CONSERVATIVE directive and avoiding overnight holds. Building on previous successful sell decision at +31.49%.\n- sell : Appropriate application of stop-loss discipline in fear market conditions. Recognized catastrophic loss scenario and prioritized capital preservation over hopeful recovery. Decision aligned with coordinator guidance for quick exits in bearish environment.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (55% quality)\n   Insight: A -100% exit is autopsy, not surgery. Stop-losses must trigger before total loss.\n   Better: Implement strict stop-losses at entry that trigger at 15-25% loss maximum. The real decision point was ignored - this should have been exited much earlier when losses were recoverable. Post-mortem should focus on why position was held to -100%.\n\n✓ **sell DINO** (87% quality)\n   Insight: 33%+ gains in F&G 28 = full exit justified; fear markets punish greed quickly\n   Better: Consider tiered exit strategy: sell 70% immediately to lock core profits, set trailing stop on remaining 30% to capture momentum continuation while protecting downside. This balances capital preservation with upside participation.\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: A -100% loss exit is not risk management - it's damage acknowledgment. Stop-losses must trigger earlier.\n   Better: Implement stricter stop-losses at 20-30% drawdown rather than allowing positions to reach -100%. In fear markets with F&G at 28, tighter risk controls should be automatic. Early warning systems for rapidly declining assets like SPARK (-54.53% in 24h) should trigger exits before catastrophic losses.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 80% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: risk, selection, execution, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.

In fear markets, premature exits before fee accumulation would be counterproductive.

Need to allow time for fee accumulation before making exit decisions.\n\n4. **Risk Management:** In the bearish market (F&G at 28), I'm staying alert for any significant drawdown that would trigger stop-loss discipline. Judge feedback emphasizes cutting losses at 15-25% rather than letting positions deteriorate to catastrophic levels.\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment:** Conservative directive aligns with holding existing quality positions rather than churning in fear markets.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Monitor positions for any significant PnL movement\n- Apply 15-25% stop-loss if drawdown occurs\n- Lock gains at 20-33% if we reach profit targets given bearish conditions"}],"metadata":{"domain":"dlmm","model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","tokensUsed":311}}
