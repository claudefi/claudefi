Focus on high-TVL pools with strong fee generation.\n\n\n## Balance\n$2500.00 available for DLMM\n\n## Open Positions (0)\nNo open positions\n\n## Recent Decisions\nNo recent decisions\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (DLMM)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Review new positions within 24hrs to catch thesis violations before they compound.\n- Repeated execution failures need root cause analysis, not just retry attempts.\n- 32% gain in fear market = exit immediately, but debug execution failures after 2 attempts\n- Cut losers early when entry thesis was flawed - don't wait for 99% loss\n- When exits repeatedly fail, diagnose the blocker before retrying - persistence without analysis is not discipline.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Clear acknowledgment of initial entry error (buying YES at 50% when estimate was 35%). Good discipline in cleaning up a flawed position despite psychological difficulty of realizing losses. Proper documentation of the original thesis violation.\n- sell : Excellent adherence to CONSERVATIVE mandate and judge feedback. 31.46% gain in fear market (F&G 28) is substantial and exit is correctly prioritized. Good recognition of liquidity conditions ($227k liquidity, $2.5M volume) enabling clean execution. Persistence through 5 failed attempts shows discipline.\n- sell : Excellent discipline in following learned rules about profit-taking in fear markets. Clear reasoning linking 31.81% gain with F&G 28 fear conditions. Strong acknowledgment of conservative mandate and overnight risk. Persistence through multiple attempts shows commitment to risk management over greed.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Review new positions within 24hrs to catch thesis violations before they compound.\n   Better: Should have recognized the thesis violation within hours/days of entry and exited immediately, or better yet, never entered the position. Implement position review within 24-48 hours of any entry to validate edge alignment.\n\n✓ **sell ** (92% quality)\n   Insight: Repeated execution failures need root cause analysis, not just retry attempts.\n   Better: After 2-3 failed exit attempts, should implement diagnostic check on execution layer before continuing. Consider partial exits if full position exits keep failing. Document specific error types for each failure.\n\n✓ **sell ** (95% quality)\n   Insight: 32% gain in fear market = exit immediately, but debug execution failures after 2 attempts\n   Better: After 2 failed exit attempts, should escalate to alternative execution methods (limit orders, split exits) rather than repeating the same approach 5 times.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 88% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: risk, execution, selection\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio. Make a decision.\n\n1. Use fetch tools to get current market data\n2. Analyze opportunities and risks\n3.

Given bearish market sentiment (F&G 28) and CONSERVATIVE mandate, the appropriate action is to hold and observe. Positions are in high-TVL, established pools: SOL-USDC (2 pools with $6.7M and $2.3M TVL, 59-139% APR) and PENGU-USDC ($4.2M TVL, 85.6% APR). These choices align with the directive to focus on high-TVL pools with strong fee generation. Per judge feedback, I should review positions within 24hrs to catch thesis violations - but there's nothing to violate yet since positions just opened.

Monitor positions for fee accumulation\n2. If any position hits 20-30%+ gains, consider taking profits (especially in fear market)\n3. If market conditions worsen significantly, may need to exit to protect capital\n4. Watch for impermanent loss if SOL price moves dramatically\n\n**Confidence:** 75% - High confidence in hold decision given constraints (max positions) and early position state (0% PnL)."}],"metadata":{"domain":"dlmm","model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","tokensUsed":283}}
