Focus on high-TVL pools with strong fee generation.\n\n\n## Balance\n$2500.00 available for DLMM\n\n## Open Positions (0)\nNo open positions\n\n## Recent Decisions\nNo recent decisions\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (DLMM)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- After 2 failed exits, diagnose the failure mode before retry #3\n- Exit negative-edge positions immediately - time in bad trades compounds mistakes.\n- Never enter when market price exceeds your probability estimate - that's buying negative edge.\n- After 3 failed executions, diagnose root cause before retry - don't just repeat.\n- Review new positions within 24hrs to catch thesis violations before they compound.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Strong profit-taking discipline at +26.67% in fear market (28). Persistent execution despite 7 prior failed attempts shows commitment to thesis. Good risk awareness with conservative approach.\n- sell : Strong discipline in recognizing and correcting a thesis-violated position. Clear acknowledgment that the original entry violated fundamental trading principles (buying YES at 50% with only 35% probability estimate). Persistence in cleanup despite potential technical issues with previous sell attempts. High confidence in the correct decision to exit.\n- sell : Strong self-accountability in acknowledging the original thesis violation. Correct prioritization of portfolio cleanup before new trades. Good recognition that entry was fundamentally flawed (bought YES at 50% with 35% probability estimate). Persistence in attempting to exit despite previous failures.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: After 2 failed exits, diagnose the failure mode before retry #3\n   Better: After 2-3 failed attempts, should have: 1) Diagnosed execution failure mode, 2) Adjusted order parameters (smaller size, different slippage tolerance), 3) Considered partial exits instead of full position. Document failure modes for future reference.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Exit negative-edge positions immediately - time in bad trades compounds mistakes.\n   Better: Before selling, briefly reassess if the 35% probability estimate is still valid given market movement to 60%. If thesis remains unchanged, sell is correct. Also investigate the -99.9% loss display error to ensure proper execution.\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Never enter when market price exceeds your probability estimate - that's buying negative edge.\n   Better: Should have implemented hard stop-loss rules at entry time. When entry thesis is violated (buying YES at 50% with 35% estimate), immediate exit within same session should be mandatory. Consider using limit orders at slightly below market to ensure execution if previous market orders failed.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 85% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, risk, selection\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio. Make a decision.\n\n1. Use fetch tools to get current market data\n2. Analyze opportunities and risks\n3. Use submit_decision to record your action\n\nYou MUST call submit_decision with your final decision.\n","metadata":{"domain":"dlmm"}}

I'm at max positions (3/3)\n2. Market is bearish with fear sentiment\n3. All positions are fresh with 0% PnL\n4. The coordinator directive is CONSERVATIVE\n\nThe best action is to **HOLD** and let these positions generate fees. Since they're all in high-TVL, stable pools with decent APRs, they should perform well even in bearish conditions. The 0% PnL indicates they're new, so I should let them mature and generate returns before making changes.\n\nHowever, the paper trading mode encourages action. I could consider partial removal of the spot position in PENGU-USDC since it's more volatile than SOL-USDC in a bearish market... but with 0% PnL and 84% APR, it seems premature to exit."},{"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_01H3Rn6qPqM5rBM6pNp14W59","name":"submit_decision","input":{"action":"hold","reasoning":"Currently at maximum 3 positions with all showing 0% PnL (recently opened).
