Focus on high-TVL pools with strong fee generation.\n\n\n## Balance\n$2500.00 available for DLMM\n\n## Open Positions (0)\nNo open positions\n\n## Recent Decisions\nNo recent decisions\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (DLMM)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Never enter when market price implies 6x your probability estimate - the edge must exist at entry.\n- Hesitation past 20% gains in fear markets is gambling, not strategy - automate exits.\n- Multiple exit attempts signal hesitation - set hard rules and execute on first trigger\n- In fear markets, full profit-taking on 30%+ gains beats partial exits - velocity matters.\n- Exit discipline matters as much as entry discipline - set loss thresholds upfront.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent self-awareness and accountability. Agent correctly identifies the root cause (entry discipline failure, buying at 50% implied when estimate was 8%). Applying lesson about attention costs and exit discipline. Clean reasoning about freeing cognitive overhead in bearish conditions.\n- sell : Excellent execution discipline after multiple hesitation attempts. Strong adherence to established rules: 20%+ gains in fear markets (F&G 28) warrant full exits. Proper acknowledgment of overnight risk with conservative mandate. Good liquidity verification before execution. Clear reasoning chain connecting prior judge feedback to action.\n- sell : Excellent discipline - executing exit at +32% gain despite 4 attempts, strong alignment with conservative mandate, proper risk management for overnight exposure in fear market (F&G 28), verified liquidity adequacy ($228K) before exit decision\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Never enter when market price implies 6x your probability estimate - the edge must exist at entry.\n   Better: The better approach was at entry: never buy when implied odds are 6x higher than your probability estimate. For this exit specifically, the decision is correct - no improvement needed.\n\n✓ **sell ** (92% quality)\n   Insight: Hesitation past 20% gains in fear markets is gambling, not strategy - automate exits.\n   Better: Implement automated exit triggers at 20% threshold in fear markets to eliminate hesitation. The 10% additional gain from waiting was lucky, not strategic.\n\n✓ **sell ** (91% quality)\n   Insight: Multiple exit attempts signal hesitation - set hard rules and execute on first trigger\n   Better: Implement hard exit rules at 20% in fear markets to avoid decision fatigue from multiple attempts, use limit orders with time bounds to ensure execution rather than repeated manual decisions\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 86% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: selection, execution, risk\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio. Make a decision.\n\n1. Use fetch tools to get current market data\n2. Analyze opportunities and risks\n3. Use submit_decision to record your action\n\nYou MUST call submit_decision with your final decision.\n","metadata":{"domain":"dlmm"}}

These established pairs offer better risk profiles than meme coins. Exiting at 0% P&L would incur fees with no benefit.

Exiting now would just incur transaction costs with no strategic benefit\n3. **Quality pool selection** - Current positions are in established pools:\n   - SOL-USDC (bin step 10): $6.8M TVL, 59.3% APR\n   - SOL-USDC (bin step 4): $2.4M TVL, 138.1% APR  \n   - PENGU-USDC: $4.2M TVL, 85.4% APR\n4. **Fee generation needed** - In a bearish market, the APRs (59-138%) need time to accumulate and offset potential impermanent loss\n5. **Discipline application** - Per judge feedback, I'm setting clear exit thresholds:\n   - Cut losses at -10%\n   - Take profits at +20% (full exit in fear market, not partial)\n\n**Confidence: 72%**\n\nThe moderate confidence reflects the inherent uncertainty of holding during a bearish market. However, the alternative (exiting at breakeven) has clear costs with no clear benefit. The positions need time to prove whether the fee generation can overcome IL risk."}],"metadata":{"domain":"dlmm","model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","tokensUsed":329}}
