Focus on high-TVL pools with strong fee generation.\n\n\n## Balance\n$2500.00 available for DLMM\n\n## Open Positions (0)\nNo open positions\n\n## Recent Decisions\nNo recent decisions\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (DLMM)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- When exits repeatedly fail, diagnose the blocker before retrying - persistence without analysis is not discipline.\n- Never enter when market price implies 6x your probability estimate - the edge must exist at entry.\n- Hesitation past 20% gains in fear markets is gambling, not strategy - automate exits.\n- Multiple exit attempts signal hesitation - set hard rules and execute on first trigger\n- In fear markets, full profit-taking on 30%+ gains beats partial exits - velocity matters.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent discipline and learning from previous feedback. Clear recognition of multiple risk factors: memecoin volatility, fear market conditions, conservative mandate violation, and adequate liquidity for exit. The 98% confidence reflects appropriate conviction after multiple failed attempts. Correctly prioritized rule execution over profit maximization.\n- sell : Excellent self-awareness and accountability. Agent correctly identifies the root cause (entry discipline failure, buying at 50% implied when estimate was 8%). Applying lesson about attention costs and exit discipline. Clean reasoning about freeing cognitive overhead in bearish conditions.\n- sell : Excellent execution discipline after multiple hesitation attempts. Strong adherence to established rules: 20%+ gains in fear markets (F&G 28) warrant full exits. Proper acknowledgment of overnight risk with conservative mandate. Good liquidity verification before execution. Clear reasoning chain connecting prior judge feedback to action.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (92% quality)\n   Insight: When exits repeatedly fail, diagnose the blocker before retrying - persistence without analysis is not discipline.\n   Better: After the second failed exit attempt, should have: 1) diagnosed the failure reason, 2) adjusted execution parameters if needed (smaller chunks, different timing), 3) documented the blocker for system improvement.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Never enter when market price implies 6x your probability estimate - the edge must exist at entry.\n   Better: The better approach was at entry: never buy when implied odds are 6x higher than your probability estimate. For this exit specifically, the decision is correct - no improvement needed.\n\n✓ **sell ** (92% quality)\n   Insight: Hesitation past 20% gains in fear markets is gambling, not strategy - automate exits.\n   Better: Implement automated exit triggers at 20% threshold in fear markets to eliminate hesitation. The 10% additional gain from waiting was lucky, not strategic.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 86% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: execution, selection, risk\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio.
