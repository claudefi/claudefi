Focus on high-TVL pools with strong fee generation.\n\n\n## Balance\n$2500.00 available for DLMM\n\n## Open Positions (0)\nNo open positions\n\n## Recent Decisions\nNo recent decisions\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (DLMM)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- 33%+ gains in F&G 28 = full exit justified; fear markets punish greed quickly\n- A -100% loss exit is not risk management - it's damage acknowledgment. Stop-losses must trigger earlier.\n- Always verify trade direction matches your probability thesis BEFORE entry, not after.\n- Lock 80%+ of gains at target in fear markets; let 20% ride with tight stop\n- Always verify: if your estimate < market price, you should be SHORT, not LONG.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell DINO: Excellent application of learned patterns: securing 33%+ gains in fear market conditions (F&G 28) aligns perfectly with judge guidance to lock 80%+ of gains. Strong adherence to coordinator's CONSERVATIVE directive and avoiding overnight holds. Building on previous successful sell decision at +31.49%.\n- sell : Appropriate application of stop-loss discipline in fear market conditions. Recognized catastrophic loss scenario and prioritized capital preservation over hopeful recovery. Decision aligned with coordinator guidance for quick exits in bearish environment.\n- sell : Excellent self-awareness in recognizing a critical directional error. Using a systematic pre-trade checklist to validate position direction. Prioritizing this as the most severe mismatch among multiple problematic positions. High confidence in the corrective action despite the painful realized loss.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell DINO** (87% quality)\n   Insight: 33%+ gains in F&G 28 = full exit justified; fear markets punish greed quickly\n   Better: Consider tiered exit strategy: sell 70% immediately to lock core profits, set trailing stop on remaining 30% to capture momentum continuation while protecting downside. This balances capital preservation with upside participation.\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: A -100% loss exit is not risk management - it's damage acknowledgment. Stop-losses must trigger earlier.\n   Better: Implement stricter stop-losses at 20-30% drawdown rather than allowing positions to reach -100%. In fear markets with F&G at 28, tighter risk controls should be automatic. Early warning systems for rapidly declining assets like SPARK (-54.53% in 24h) should trigger exits before catastrophic losses.\n\n✓ **sell ** (85% quality)\n   Insight: Always verify trade direction matches your probability thesis BEFORE entry, not after.\n   Better: Implement mandatory pre-trade directional validation: If estimate < market, go SHORT. If estimate > market, go LONG. Add automatic position review triggers when loss exceeds 20-30%. Never hold a position where your thesis contradicts your direction.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 83% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: risk, selection, execution, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio. Make a decision.\n\n1. Use fetch tools to get current market data\n2. Analyze opportunities and risks\n3. Use submit_decision to record your action\n\nYou MUST call submit_decision with your final decision.\n","metadata":{"domain":"dlmm"}}

PENGU-USDC: $320 (0.0% PnL) - spot strategy\n  2. SOL-USDC (bin 10): $400 (0.0% PnL) - spot strategy  \n  3. SOL-USDC (bin 4): $500 (0.0% PnL) - curve strategy\n\n### Market Context\n- **Sentiment:** BEARISH with Fear & Greed at 28 (extreme fear)\n- **Major assets:** BTC, ETH, SOL all down 2-4%\n- **Coordinator directive:** CONSERVATIVE, focus on high-TVL pools with strong fee generation\n\n### Position Analysis\nAll 3 positions are in high-quality, high-TVL pools:\n1. **PENGU-USDC** ($4.2M TVL, 83.3% APR) - Solid pool, decent fee generation\n2. **SOL-USDC bin 10** ($6.8M TVL, 49.4% APR) - Excellent TVL, reliable\n3. **SOL-USDC bin 4** ($2.4M TVL, 111% APR) - Good APR, decent TVL\n\nAll positions are at 0% PnL, meaning they were just opened. In a bearish market with extreme fear (F&G 28), newly opened positions are at risk.\n\n### Key Considerations\n1. **Already at max positions (3)** - Cannot add more liquidity\n2. **All positions are new with 0% PnL** - No gains to lock in yet\n3. **Bearish market with extreme fear** - Judge feedback warns about fear markets punishing greed\n4. **CONSERVATIVE directive** - Should focus on capital preservation\n\n### Decision Framework\nThe judge feedback emphasizes:\n- Lock 80%+ of gains at target in fear markets\n- Stop-losses must trigger earlier (at 20-30% drawdown, not -100%)\n- Fear markets punish greed quickly\n\nSince all positions are at 0% PnL and in high-quality pools (high TVL, reasonable APR), there's no immediate reason to exit. However, in a bearish market, I should be vigilant. The pools I'm in are the most stable ones (SOL-USDC and PENGU-USDC with high TVL).\n\nGiven:\n- I'm at max positions\n- All positions are flat (no gains/losses)\n- All pools have good fundamentals (high TVL, reasonable APR)\n- Bearish market suggests caution but not panic exit\n\nThe appropriate action is to **HOLD** and monitor these positions closely. In a fear market, positions in major pairs like SOL-USDC should be more resilient than memecoins."},{"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_01F6XBG8aCgXkEGr7t29vvfv","name":"submit_decision","input":{"action":"hold","reasoning":"Currently at maximum 3 positions, all in high-quality pools (SOL-USDC and PENGU-USDC with $2.4M-$6.8M TVL).
