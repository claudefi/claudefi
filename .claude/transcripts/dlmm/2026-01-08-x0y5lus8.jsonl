Focus on high-TVL pools with strong fee generation.\n\n\n## Balance\n$2500.00 available for DLMM\n\n## Open Positions (0)\nNo open positions\n\n## Recent Decisions\nNo recent decisions\n\n---\n\n## Recent Judge Feedback (DLMM)\n\n*Based on 10 recent decision evaluations*\n\n### Key Insights from Recent Decisions\n\n- Break-even exits in fear markets are wins - capital preserved beats hope.\n- Directional errors demand same-day reversal, not end-of-life cleanup.\n- A -100% exit is autopsy, not surgery. Stop-losses must trigger before total loss.\n- 33%+ gains in F&G 28 = full exit justified; fear markets punish greed quickly\n- A -100% loss exit is not risk management - it's damage acknowledgment. Stop-losses must trigger earlier.\n\n### Patterns That Worked\n\n*These approaches were validated as good decisions:*\n\n- sell : Excellent risk discipline by following coordinator's CONSERVATIVE directive and avoiding overnight holds in fear market. Good pattern recognition referencing previous successful DINO exit. Rational decision to preserve capital at break-even rather than gambling on continued momentum.\n- sell : Clear recognition of the directional error pattern (estimate < market = buy NO, not YES). Good discipline in cleaning up zombie positions rather than holding false hope. Correctly prioritizes position cleanup before new trades. Strong self-awareness about the systematic mistake.\n- sell : Correct decision to exit a catastrophically losing position. Recognition that salvaging any remaining value is better than holding through continued decline. Alignment with conservative risk mandate and avoiding overnight exposure in bearish conditions.\n\n### Most Recent Evaluations\n\n✓ **sell ** (78% quality)\n   Insight: Break-even exits in fear markets are wins - capital preserved beats hope.\n   Better: Set trailing stops on positions showing significant gains (+36%) to lock in profits automatically rather than letting them erode back to break-even. The strong buy ratio (65%) could have justified a tighter trailing stop rather than manual monitoring.\n\n✓ **sell ** (75% quality)\n   Insight: Directional errors demand same-day reversal, not end-of-life cleanup.\n   Better: Implement a pre-trade checklist: 'My estimate is X%, market is Y%, therefore I should buy [YES/NO]' - verbalize this before every trade. Set automated alerts for positions that move >50% against you within first 24-48 hours to catch directional errors immediately.\n\n✓ **sell ** (55% quality)\n   Insight: A -100% exit is autopsy, not surgery. Stop-losses must trigger before total loss.\n   Better: Implement strict stop-losses at entry that trigger at 15-25% loss maximum. The real decision point was ignored - this should have been exited much earlier when losses were recoverable. Post-mortem should focus on why position was held to -100%.\n\n### Decision Calibration\n\nRecent decision quality: 79% average\nJudge accuracy: N/A% (0/0 predictions correct)\nInsight types: risk, execution, selection, timing\n\n\n## Market Data Available\nUse the fetch tools to get LIVE market data.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the market and your portfolio. Make a decision.\n\n1. Use fetch tools to get current market data\n2. Analyze opportunities and risks\n3. Use submit_decision to record your action\n\nYou MUST call submit_decision with your final decision.\n","metadata":{"domain":"dlmm"}}

According to the judge feedback patterns:\n- \"Break-even exits in fear markets are wins - capital preserved beats hope\"\n- \"-100% loss exit is autopsy, not surgery. Stop-losses must trigger before total loss\"\n\nHowever, I'm in high-quality, high-TVL pools:\n- All three pools have TVL > $2M (safe)\n- SOL-USDC pools are stable pairs with solid fee generation\n- PENGU-USDC has 83.8% APR with $4.2M TVL\n\nThe current positions are:\n1.

The judge's advice about \"break-even exits in fear markets\" applies more to risky positions that have eroded from gains. These positions just opened and are in solid, high-TVL pools that should generate fees.
