# Skill: Stop Loss Discipline - Exit Early, Not Late

## Pattern to Recognize

**Warning Signs Before This Trade Failed:**
- Position was opened as a short against TAO when it was "overbought"
- No hard stop loss was set at entry (or it wasn't respected)
- Position was held while losses compounded from -10% → -20% → -50% → -66.7%
- The exit reasoning mentions "max -10% stop loss" but the actual loss was 6.7x larger

**The Classic Pattern:**
- Open position with a thesis (short overbought asset)
- Market moves against position
- Hope for reversal instead of executing stop loss
- Finally close when pain becomes unbearable, not at predetermined exit

## What Went Wrong

1. **Stop Loss Was Theoretical, Not Executed**: The conservative directive specified -10% max loss, but the position was held to -66.7% loss. The stop loss existed in documentation but not in practice.

2. **Thesis Invalidation Came Too Late**: The reasoning for closing mentions "thesis invalidated" - but a -66.7% loss means the thesis was invalidated much earlier. The agent kept holding hoping for recovery.

3. **No Position Monitoring Protocol**: Between opening the short and this close, there should have been multiple checkpoints where the -10% stop was triggered. Either these weren't happening or they were overridden.

4. **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Once down significantly, there's psychological pressure to "wait for it to come back" rather than accept the loss. This turned a -10% loss into a -66.7% loss.

## Better Approach

### At Entry
- Set a hard stop loss price/level, not just a percentage in your reasoning
- Calculate: "If TAO moves above $X, I exit no matter what"
- Document this number explicitly in the trade reasoning

### During Position
- Check P&L against stop loss threshold EVERY cycle
- If unrealized loss exceeds -10%, the decision is already made - execute the close
- Do not re-evaluate the thesis when stop is hit - the stop IS the thesis invalidation

### The Key Insight
**A stop loss is not a suggestion to reconsider - it's a pre-commitment to act.**

When you set -10% stop loss at entry, you are making a binding agreement with your future self. The market has infinite ways to convince you to hold "just a little longer."

## Checklist: Before Holding a Losing Position

```
□ What is my current unrealized P&L percentage?
□ Does this exceed my stated stop loss threshold (-10% for conservative)?
□ If YES → Close immediately. Do not proceed to next questions.
□ If NO → Continue monitoring.

□ Am I rationalizing holding because "it might come back"?
□ Am I avoiding closing because realizing the loss feels worse than unrealized?
□ Would I open this exact position fresh right now at current prices?
```

## Hard Rules for Perps Positions

1. **-10% unrealized loss = mandatory close** (conservative mode)
2. **No exceptions for "thesis review"** - the stop loss IS the thesis boundary
3. **Check stop loss status BEFORE analyzing market conditions** - don't let bullish/bearish analysis override risk management
4. **Log every time a position passes -5%** - this is the early warning

## Example Application

**Wrong approach (what happened):**
```
Position: -30% unrealized
Thinking: "Let me check if my thesis is still valid... RSI, EMA, momentum..."
Result: Keep holding, eventually close at -66.7%
```

**Correct approach:**
```
Position: -10% unrealized
Thinking: "Stop loss threshold reached. Closing position."
Action: Close immediately
Result: -10% loss, capital preserved for better opportunities
```

## Remember

The difference between -10% and -66.7% on a $60 position is $34. Across many trades, disciplined stop losses are the difference between sustainable trading and account destruction.

**A small loss taken on time is a successful risk management event, not a failure.**
