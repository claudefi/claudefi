# Skill: Position Entry and Stop-Loss Execution Discipline

## Pattern to Recognize

**Pre-Entry Warning Signs:**
- Entering a position without a clearly defined stop-loss level set at entry
- Position sizing that doesn't account for stop-loss distance (risk per trade)
- No automated stop-loss order placed immediately upon position opening
- Entering trades during volatile conditions without tighter stops

**During-Trade Warning Signs:**
- Position reaches -10% loss without automatic stop execution
- Finding yourself "monitoring" a losing position instead of having stops already in place
- Any rationalization about why the original stop-loss level should be moved
- Position losses exceeding any reasonable risk-per-trade allocation

## What Went Wrong

### Root Cause Analysis

This $60 SOL position lost 66.7% ($40) before being closed. The skill that triggered the close (`warning-perps-1767917147919`) was designed to catch exactly this scenario - but it caught it **far too late**.

**Critical Failures:**
1. **No stop-loss at entry**: The position was opened without an immediate stop-loss order
2. **Manual monitoring failed**: Relying on periodic checks instead of automated stops allowed the loss to compound from -10% to -66.7%
3. **Delayed recognition**: By the time the skill triggered a close, 6.67x the intended maximum loss had occurred
4. **Position sizing disconnect**: If -10% was the acceptable loss, the position should have been sized so that represented the maximum dollar loss tolerated

**The Math That Should Have Happened:**
- Entry: $60 position
- Intended stop: -10% = $6 maximum loss
- Actual loss: $40 (6.67x the intended maximum)
- The difference ($34) represents pure execution failure, not market risk

## Better Approach

### Entry Protocol
1. **Before clicking "open position"**: Define exact stop-loss price level
2. **Immediately after entry**: Place stop-loss order - not a mental note, an actual order
3. **Position size formula**: `Position Size = (Acceptable $ Loss) / (Stop Loss %)`
   - Example: If willing to lose $6 with 10% stop → Position = $60
   - Example: If willing to lose $6 with 5% stop → Position = $120

### Stop-Loss Execution Rules
- **Hard stops are non-negotiable**: Once set, stops only move in profitable direction (trailing), never against
- **Automated > Manual**: Always prefer exchange stop-loss orders over manual monitoring
- **If no stop-loss capability**: Reduce position size by 50% to account for execution lag

### Recovery Protocol (When You're Already Deep in Loss)
When discovering a position far beyond stop-loss (like this -66.7%):
1. **Close immediately** - The skill did this correctly
2. **Do not average down** - The temptation to "recover" by adding is the path to larger losses
3. **Document the entry failure** - What prevented the stop from executing at -10%?

## Pre-Trade Checklist

### Before Opening ANY Perps Position:

- [ ] **Stop-loss price defined?** Write the exact price level
- [ ] **Stop-loss order ready?** Can I place this order immediately after entry?
- [ ] **Position size calculated?** Does (position × stop %) = acceptable $ loss?
- [ ] **Risk per trade ≤ 2%?** Of total portfolio, not just available margin
- [ ] **No existing positions need attention?** Close/manage losers before opening new trades

### Immediately After Entry:

- [ ] **Stop-loss order placed?** Verify it's live on the exchange
- [ ] **Screenshot/record entry?** Entry price, stop price, position size, thesis
- [ ] **Set alert at -5%?** Early warning before stop triggers

### Position Monitoring (If Manual Stops Required):

- [ ] **Check frequency defined?** Every 1 hour minimum during volatile periods
- [ ] **Hard cutoff time?** If can't monitor for X hours, close or reduce position
- [ ] **Loss exceeds -10%?** → **IMMEDIATE CLOSE, NO EXCEPTIONS**

## Key Principle

> "The stop-loss is decided BEFORE the trade, executed DURING the trade, and never reconsidered. A -66.7% loss from a -10% intended stop isn't bad luck - it's execution failure. The market didn't betray you; the process did."

## When This Skill Applies

- **Domain**: Perpetual futures (perps), leveraged positions
- **Trigger**: Any position entry or any position currently held without active stop-loss
- **Priority**: This skill overrides momentum signals, thesis confidence, and recovery hopes
