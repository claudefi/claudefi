**1/**

the Claude Agent SDK just mass-shifted what's possible

i've spent 18 months building AI agents. this is different.

i used it to build the first autonomous agent that trades across all 4 major DeFi domains

it's open source. here's what makes it work

---

**2/**

what "autonomous" means here:

- watches markets 24/7
- reasons about opportunities
- executes trades
- learns from every outcome

not signals. not alerts. actual decisions. actual trades. actual learning.

---

**3/**

4 domains, one agent:

- DLMM - concentrated liquidity (Meteora)
- Perps - leveraged futures (Hyperliquid)
- Spot - memecoin hunting (Jupiter)
- Polymarket - prediction markets

these are the 4 ways people actually make money in DeFi right now

---

**4/**

the core is a 30-minute cycle called the ralph loop:

1. OBSERVE - fetch live market data
2. THINK - analyze with learned skills
3. ACT - execute validated trades
4. LEARN - generate skills from outcomes

simple. relentless. compounding.

---

**5/**

the skill system is where it gets interesting

after every trade, the agent writes a skill file explaining what happened and why

losses become warnings. wins become patterns.

these skills load into context on every future cycle

---

**6/**

but skills don't just accumulate - they evolve

- 70% similar? merge into one evolved skill
- below 30% effectiveness? excluded from future decisions
- older than 60-180 days? archived

the agent knows when to learn. and when to forget.

---

**7/**

a separate judge agent evaluates every decision

not just "did it make money" but "was this a good decision given the information available"

those insights get synthesized and injected into the next cycle

this closes the feedback loop that makes learning actually work

---

**8/**

production-quality risk infrastructure:

- global drawdown limit: -15%
- domain drawdown limit: -20%
- position cap: 3 per domain
- confidence threshold: 60%
- human approval: trades >$500

this isn't a toy.

---

**9/**

runs ~$13/day in API costs

that's less than most signal services. except this one learns, improves, and you own it completely.

your keys never leave your machine. no cloud. no backend. complete sovereignty.

---

**10/**

paper trading is ON by default

watch it think. read its reasoning. see what skills it creates.

only when you're ready - and accept the risks - do you flip to real trading.

---

**11/**

100% open source. MIT licensed.

no token. no premium tier. no waitlist.

every line of code. every prompt. every skill template.

18 months building agents led here

Claude Agent SDK made it real. skills make it learn. open source means we learn together.

built for the trenches.
